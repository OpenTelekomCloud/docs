# How Do I View All Clusters?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0125375335"></a>

On the  **Clusters**  page, you can view clusters in various states. If massive clusters are involved, you can turn pages to view clusters in any status.

-   Active Clusters: contains all clusters except the clusters in the  **Failed** or **Terminated**  state.
-   Failed Tasks: contains only the tasks in the  **Failed**  state. Task failures include:
    -   Cluster creation failure
    -   Cluster termination failure
    -   Cluster scale-out failure
    -   Cluster scale-in failure
