# How Do I View Log Information?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0125375640"></a>

On the  **Operation Logs**  page, you can view log information about users' operations on clusters and jobs only after Kerberos authentication is disabled. Currently, MRS has two types of logs:

-   Cluster: Creating, terminating, shrinking, and expanding a cluster
-   Job: Creating, stopping, and deleting a job

[Figure 1](#f30fdd2fd5a454041851332757d92af37)  shows log information about users' operations.
