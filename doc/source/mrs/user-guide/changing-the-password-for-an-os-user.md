# Changing the Password for an OS User<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0221415054"></a>

## Scenario<a name="section15950303103032"></a>

Periodically change the login passwords of the OS users  **omm**,  **ommdba**  and  **root**  of the MRS cluster node to improve the system O&M security.

The passwords of users  **omm**,**Â ommdba**  and  **root**  of the nodes can be different.

## Procedure<a name="section26299005103047"></a>

1.  Log in to the Master1 node, and then log in to other nodes whose OS user password needs to be modified.
2.  Run the following command to switch to user  **root**:

    **sudo su - root**

3.  Run the following command to change the password for  **omm/ommdba**:

    **passwd omm**

    **passwd ommdba**

    **passwd root**

    For example, if you run  **omm:passwd**, the system displays the following information:

    ```
    Changing password for  user omm.
    New password:
    ```

    Enter a new password. The policy for changing the password of an OS user varies according to the OS that is being used.

    ```
    Retype new password:
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
    ```

    >The default password complexity requirements of MRS clusters are as follows:  
    >-   The password must contain at least eight characters.  
    >-   The password must contain at least three types of the following: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, spaces, and special characters which can only be '\~!@\#$%^&\*\(\)-\_=+\\|\[\{\}\];:'",<.\>/?  
    >-   The reset password cannot be the same as the passwords that have been used in the last five times.
