Functions
=========


MRS, capable of processing and storing massive sets of data, supports the following features:

-   Enhanced open-source Hadoop software
-   Spark in-memory computing engine
-   HBase distributed storage database
-   Hive data warehouse
-   Hue web framework

It also supports cluster management. To meet service requirements, you should specify the node quantity and data disk space when applying for MRS. Then you need only focus on data analysis.
