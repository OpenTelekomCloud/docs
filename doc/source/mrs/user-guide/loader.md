Loader is a data migration component developed based on Apache Sqoop. It quickens and simplifies data migration between Hadoop and structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources. Loader can both import and export data into and out of MRS clusters.

Loader provides the following features:

-   Uses a high-available service architecture.
-   Supports data migration using a client.
-   Manages data migration jobs.
-   Supports data processing during migration.
-   Runs migration jobs using MapReduce components.

For details about the Loader architecture and principles, see  [http://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.99.7/index.html](http://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.99.7/index.html).
