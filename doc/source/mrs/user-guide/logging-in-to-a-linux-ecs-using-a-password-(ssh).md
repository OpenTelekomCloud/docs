# Logging In to a Linux ECS Using a Password \(SSH\)<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0125376041"></a>

Logging in to a Linux ECS in SSH password authentication mode is disabled by default. If you require the password authentication mode, configure it after logging in to the ECS. To ensure system security, you must reset the common user password for logging in to the Linux ECS after configuring the SSH password authentication mode.

All nodes in the MRS cluster use the Linux OS. For details about logging in to a Linux ECS using a password, see "Logging In to a Linux ECS Using a Password \(SSH\)" in the ECS User Guide \(**Getting Started \> Logging In to an ECS \> Logging In to a Linux ECS Using a Password \(SSH\)**\).
