On MRS Manager, nodes in a cluster can be classified into management nodes, control nodes, and data nodes. The change trends of key host monitoring metrics on each type of node can be calculated and displayed as curve charts in reports based on the customized periods. If a host belongs to multiple node types, the metric statistics will be repeatedly collected.

This section provides overview of MRS clusters and describes how to view, customize, and export node monitoring metrics on MRS Manager.
