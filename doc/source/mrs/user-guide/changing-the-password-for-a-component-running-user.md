# Changing the Password for a Component Running User<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0221415059"></a>

## Scenario<a name="section4448694316200"></a>

Periodically change the password for each component running user of the MRS cluster to improve the system O&M security.

If the initial password is randomly generated by the system, reset the initial password.

If the password is changed, the downloaded user credential will be unavailable. You need to download the authentication credential again, and replace the old credential with new one.

## Impact on the System<a name="section10309800162022"></a>

The initial password of a component running user is randomly generated by the system and needs to be changed. After the password changes, the MRS cluster needs to be restarted, during which services are temporarily interrupted.

## Prerequisites<a name="section50585329162049"></a>

A client has been prepared on the Master1 node.

## Procedure<a name="section14064511163955"></a>

1.  Log in to the Master1 node.
2.  \(Optional\) If you want to change the password as user  **omm**, run the following command to switch the user:

    **sudo su - omm**

3.  Run the following command to go to the client directory, for example,  **/opt/client**.

    **cd /opt/client**

4.  Run the following command to configure the environment variables:

    **source bigdata\_env**

5.  Run the following command to log in to the console as  **kadmin/admin**:

    **kadmin -p kadmin/admin**

    >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >The default password of  **kadmin/admin**  is  **KAdmin@123**, which will expire upon your first login. Change the password as prompted and keep the new password secure.  

6.  Run the following command to change the password of an internal system user. The password change takes effect on all servers.

    **cpw**Â _component running user_

    For example:  **cpw oms/manager**

    For the MRS 1.6.3 or later cluster, the password complexity requirements are as follows:

    -   The password must contain 8 to 32 characters.
    -   The password must contain at least three types of the following: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, spaces, and special characters which can only be \~\`!?,.:;-\_'\(\)\{\}\[\]/<\>@\#$%^&\*+|\\=
    -   The password cannot be the same as the username or reverse username.
