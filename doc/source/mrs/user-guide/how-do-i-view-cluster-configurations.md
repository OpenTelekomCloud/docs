# How Do I View Cluster Configurations?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0125375829"></a>

-   After a cluster is created, you can choose  **Clusters \> Active Clusters**, select a running cluster, and click its name to switch to the cluster details page. You can view the basic configuration information about a cluster. The instance specifications and capacities of nodes determine the data analysis and processing capability of a cluster. More advanced instance specifications and larger capacity allow faster cluster running and better data processing, and accordingly require higher cluster costs.
-   Choose  **Clusters \> Active Clusters**, select a running cluster, click its name to switch to the cluster details page, and then click **View**  to go to the cluster management page. On the MRS cluster management page that is displayed, you can view and process alarm information, modify cluster configurations, and install cluster patches.
