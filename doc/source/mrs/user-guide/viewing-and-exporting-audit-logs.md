## Scenario<a name="section586257321787"></a>

On MRS Manager, view and export audit logs for post-event tracing, fault cause locating, and responsibility classification of security events.

The system records the following log information:

-   User activity information, such as user login and logout, and modifications to system user and system user group information
-   Information about user operation instructions, such as cluster startups and shutdowns, and software upgrades.

## Procedure<a name="section1990362217839"></a>

-   View the audit logs.
    1.  On MRS Manager, click  **Audit**  to view the default audit logs.

        If the content of the audit log contains more than 256 characters, click the unfold button to unfold audit details and then click  **log file**  to download the complete log file.

        -   By default, audit logs are displayed in descending order by  **Occurred On**. You can click **Operation Type**, **Severity**, **Occurred On**, **User**, **Host**, **Service**, **Instance**, or **Operation Result**  to change the display mode.
        -   You can filter out all audit logs of the same severity in  **Severity**, including both cleared and uncleared alarms.

        Export the audit logs, which contain the following information:

        -   **Sno**: indicates the number of audit logs generated by MRS Manager. The number is incremented by 1 when a new audit log is generated.
        -   **Operation Type**: indicates the type of user operations. User operations are classified into the following scenarios: **User\_Manager**,  **Cluster**,  **Service**,  **Host**,  **Alarm**,  **Collect Log**,  **Auditlog**,  **Backup And Restoration**,  **Tenant**. **User\_Manager** is supported only by clusters with Kerberos authentication enabled. Each scenario contains different operation types. For example, **Alarms** contains **Export alarms**, **Clusters** contains **Start Cluster**, and **Tenant** contains **Add Tenant**.
        -   **Severity**: indicates the security level of each audit log, including **Critical**, **Major**, **Minor**, and **Information**.
        -   **Start Time**: indicates the GMT+01:00 or GMT+02:00 time when a user operation starts.
        -   **End Time**: indicates the GMT+01:00 or GMT+02:00 time when a user operation ends.
        -   **User IP Address**: indicates the IP address used by a user.
        -   **User**: indicates the name of a user who performs the operations.
        -   **Host**: indicates the node where a user operation is performed. The information is not saved if the operation does not involve a node.
        -   **Service**: indicates the service on which a user operation is performed. The information is not saved if the operation does not involve a service.
        -   **Instance**: indicates the role instance on which a user operation is performed. The information is not saved if the operation does not involve a role instance.
        -   **Operation Result**: indicates the user operation result, including **Successful**, **Failed**, and **Unknown**.
        -   **Content**: indicates execution information of the user operation.

    2.  Click  **Advanced Search**. In the audit log search area, set search criteria and click **Search**  to view the desired audit logs. Click **Reset**  to reset search criteria.
