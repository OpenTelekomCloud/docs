# What Is MRS?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0125375843"></a>

MapReduce Service \(MRS for short\), one of basic services on the public cloud, is used for managing and analyzing massive data.

MRS builds a reliable, secure, and easy-to-use operation and maintenance \(O&M\) platform. The platform provides analysis and computing capabilities for massive data and can address enterprises' demands on data storage and processing. Users can independently apply for and use the hosted Hadoop, Spark, HBase, and Hive components to quickly create clusters on a host, which provides batch data analysis and computing capabilities for massive data that does not have demanding requirements on real-time processing.
