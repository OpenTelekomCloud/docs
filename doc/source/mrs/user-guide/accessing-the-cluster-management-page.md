    -   If Kerberos authentication is disabled, choose  **Clusters**  \>  **Active Clusters**. Select a cluster and click its name. On the cluster information page that is displayed, click  **View**. The  **MRS Manager**  page is displayed, see  [Accessing MRS Manager](accessing-mrs-manager.md)
    -   If Kerberos authentication is enabled, access MRS Manager by referring to  [Accessing MRS Manager Supporting Kerberos Authentication](accessing-mrs-manager-supporting-kerberos-authentication.md). On the  **MRS Manager**  page, you can view and handle alarms, modify cluster configurations, and upgrade cluster patches.


You can enter the cluster management page of clusters in the  **Running**, **Expanding** or **Shrinking** state only. For details about how to use the cluster management page, see [MRS Manager Operation Guide](mrs_manager_operation_guide).
