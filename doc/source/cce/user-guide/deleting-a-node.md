-   Deleting a node will lead to pod migration, which may affect services. Perform this operation during off-peak hours.
-   Unexpected risks may occur during the operation. Back up related data in advance.
-   During the operation, the backend will set the node to the unschedulable state.
-   Only worker nodes can be deleted, and master nodes cannot.
