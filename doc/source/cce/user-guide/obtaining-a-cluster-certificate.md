# Obtaining a Cluster Certificate<a name="cce_01_0175"></a>

Before accessing cluster resources through open-source Kubernetes APIs, obtain the cluster's certificate.

## Constraints<a name="section1721011538477"></a>

-   This function works only for newly created clusters. For existing clusters, a CA certificate will not be able to update with the EIP of the master server.
-   When the EIP of the master server changes, the CA certificate still uses the old IP address \(unable to update\). In this case, the connection becomes unavailable.

## Procedure<a name="section11885122514475"></a>

1.  Log in to the CCE console. In the navigation pane, choose  **Resource Management**  \>  **Clusters**.
2.  In the card view of the target cluster, choose  **More \> Download X.509 Certificate**.
