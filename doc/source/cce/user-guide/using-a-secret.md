# Using a Secret<a name="cce_01_0016"></a>

After secrets are created, they can be mounted as  data volumes or be exposed as  environment variables to be used by a container in a pod.

>![](/images/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:**   
>The following secrets are used by the CCE system. Do not perform any operations on them.  
>-   Do not operate secrets under kube-system.  
>-   Do not operate default-secret and paas.elb in other namespaces. The default-secret is used to pull the private image of SWR, and the paas.elb is used to connect the service in the namespace to the ELB service.

The following example shows how to use a secret.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: my-username  #Username
  password: ******  #The value must be encoded using Base64.
```

>When a secret is used in a pod, the pod and secret must be in the same cluster and namespace.  

## Configuring the Data Volume of a Pod<a name="section472505211214"></a>

A secret can be used as a file in a pod. As shown in the following example, the username and password of the  **mysecret**  secret are saved in the  **/etc/foo**  directory as files.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: foo
      mountPath: "/etc/foo"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretName: mysecret
```

In addition, you can specify the directory and permission to access a secret. The username is stored in the  **/etc/foo/my-group/my-username**  directory of the container.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: foo
      mountPath: "/etc/foo"
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretName: mysecret
      items:
      - key: username
        path: my-group/my-username
        mode: 511
```

To mount a secret to a data volume, you can also perform operations on the CCE console. When creating a workload, set advanced settings for the container, choose  **Data Storage \> Local Disk**, click  **Add Local Disk**, and select  **Secret**. For details, see  [Secret](using-local-disks-for-storage.md#section10197243134710).

## Setting Environment Variables of a Pod<a name="section207271352141216"></a>

A secret can be used as an environment variable of a pod. As shown in the following example, the username and password of the  **mysecret**  secret are defined as an environment variable of the pod.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-env-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: redis
    env:
      - name: SECRET_USERNAME
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: mysecret
            key: username
      - name: SECRET_PASSWORD
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: mysecret
            key: password
  restartPolicy: Never
```
