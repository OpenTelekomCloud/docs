# Do I Need to Stop the ECS Before Restoring It?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0056584617"></a>

The system shuts down the ECS before restoring ECS data, and automatically starts up the ECS after the restoration is complete.

If you deselect  **Start the server immediately after restoration**, you need to manually start the ECS after the restoration is complete.
