# How to Access CSBS<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0056725851"></a>

Web-based service management platforms, including HTTPS-based application programming interfaces \(APIs\) and the management console, are provided for you to access the CSBS service.

-   APIs

    Use this access method if you are required to integrate the ECSs on the cloud service platform into a third-party system for secondary development. For detailed operations, see the  _Cloud Server Backup Service API Reference_.

-   Management console

    Use this access method for other operations. If you already have a cloud service account, log in to the management console and click  **Cloud Server Backup Service**  on the homepage.
