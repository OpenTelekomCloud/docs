# VBS Backup Management<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0015667849"></a>

You can set filtering criteria to query wanted backups, add tags to backups for grouped management, and share your backups with other projects. 

CSBS backups of ECSs are also displayed on the VBS backup page and can be distinguished from VBS backups by  **Source**  in the backup details.

After Instant Restore is enabled, each backup will be marked with a letter  **C**  or  **E**  at the right of its name to show whether it supports instant restoration. A backup marked with letter  **C**  is a common backup and does not support instant restoration. A backup marked with letter  **E**  is an enhanced backup and supports instant restoration. For details, see  [Instant Restore](basic-concepts.md#section1713119814918).

## Search for a VBS Backup<a name="section3521024785717"></a>

1.  Log in to the management console.
2.  Click  ![](figures/icon-region.png)  in the upper left corner of the management console and select a region and a project.

            ![](figures/my-backups.png "my-backups")

        -   On the  **Backups shared with me**  page, you can see the time when the backup is shared in the  **Shared**  column. You can search for backups by backup name, backup ID, disk ID, or owner project ID, as shown in  [Figure 2](#fig1252813127211). Click  ![](figures/icon-check.png)  to search.

            **Figure  2**  Backups shared with me<a name="fig1252813127211"></a>  
            ![](figures/backups-shared-with-me.png "backups-shared-with-me")

    -   Above the page, select a state to search for backups.

A maximum of 10 tags can be added at the same time.
        -   You can click  **Reset**  under the search criteria to reset the search criteria.

## Delete a VBS Backup<a name="section44845024152024"></a>

To delete unwanted VBS backups, ensure the backups' statuses are  **Available**  or  **Error**  and  **Source**  is  **VBS**.

Backups whose  **Source**  is  **CSBS**  can be deleted only on the CSBS management console.

## Manage Shared VBS Backups<a name="section13640821172711"></a>

A tenant can share a backup with other tenants.

Encrypted backups cannot be shared. Backups of common I/O \(performance optimized I\) and ultra-high I/O \(latency optimized\) disks cannot be shared.

Backups cannot be shared across regions. This indicates that projects sharing a backup must be in the same region as the backup.

1.  Log in to the management console.
2.  Click  ![](figures/icon-region.png)  in the upper left corner of the management console and select a region and a project.
3.  Click  ![](figures/service-list.png). Under  **Storage**, click  **Volume Backup Service**.
4.  Click  ![](figures/icon-down.png)  in the row of a backup.
5.  Click  **Shares**  in the backup details area to expand the share management panel.

    The panel displays the ID list of projects with which the backup is shared.

    -   Adding a share

    1.  In the upper left corner, click  **Share Backup**, and then the  **Share Backup**  dialog box is displayed. For details, see  [Figure 5](#fig6681214115510).

        **Figure  5**  Adding a share<a name="fig6681214115510"></a>  
        ![](figures/adding-a-share.png "adding-a-share")

    2.  Enter the project ID of the target tenant.

        >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
        >A project ID is a string of 32 characters that can contain letters and digits but cannot be digits only.  

    3.  Click  **Add**  in the dialog box to add another project ID. A tenant can share a backup with another 10 tenants.
    4.  Click  **OK**.

    -   Deleting a share

    1.  Select a share that you want to delete, and click  **Unshare**  in the  **Operation**  column.
    2.  In the dialog box that is displayed, confirm the deletion information.
    3.  Click  **OK**.
