# Why Are CSBS Backups Displayed on the VBS Backup Page?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0104564767"></a>

CSBS backups of ECSs are also displayed on the VBS backup page and can be distinguished from VBS backups by  **Source**  in the backup details.

To use CSBS to back up a server is to back up every disk of the server. These disk backups are displayed on the VBS backup list and can be directly used to restore disks.

Backups whose  **Source**  is  **CSBS**  can be deleted only on the CSBS page.
