# How Long Does VBS Take to Back Up an EVS Disk?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0018011369"></a>

The initial backup of an EVS disk is a full backup and subsequent backup operations are all incremental backups. The initial backup takes a long time whereas subsequent incremental operations are much shorter. For example, a full backup of a 50 GB EVS disk with an increment of 10 GB takes approximately 35 minutes, whereas an incremental backup takes approximately 6 minutes.
