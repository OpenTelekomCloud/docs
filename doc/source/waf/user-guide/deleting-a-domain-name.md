# Deleting a Domain Name<a name="waf_01_0005"></a>

This section describes how to delete a domain name.

>![](/images/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:**   
>-   If the domain name to be deleted has been connected to WAF, re-resolve it with the DNS provider before you delete it to make it point to the origin server IP address. Otherwise, traffic intended to it will not be directed to the server, affecting access.  
>-   Deletion takes effect within 1 minute and deleted domain names cannot be recovered. Therefore, exercise caution when deleting a domain name.
