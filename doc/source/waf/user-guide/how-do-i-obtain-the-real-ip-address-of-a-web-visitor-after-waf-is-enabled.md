# How Do I Obtain the Real IP Address of a Web Visitor After WAF Is Enabled?<a name="waf_01_0062"></a>

Generally, a proxy such as CDN, WAF, and AAD is deployed between the client and server. Web visitors cannot directly access the server. For example,  **web visitor**  \>  **CDN/WAF/AAD**  \>  **origin server**. Then, how does the server obtain the real IP address of the client when multiple proxies are used?

1.  Log in to the management console.
2.  Click  ![](figures/icon-region.png)  in the upper left corner of the management console and select a region or project.
3.  Click  **Service List**  at the top of the page and choose  **Security**  \>  **Web Application Firewall**. In the navigation pane, choose  **Domains**. The  **Domains**  page is displayed, as shown in  [Figure 1](#en-us_topic_0154713166_f6b9e0be38f9b4498a46fea967ef351ae).

4.  In the  **Name**  column, click the target domain name to go to the basic information page.
5.  View  **Source IP Header**. By default, WAF obtains the real IP address of a web visitor from the HTTP header  **X-Forwarded-For**. The first IP address in the  **X-Forwarded-For**  field is the real IP address of the web visitor. You can also click  ![](figures/icon-edit.png)  to customize the field to identify the real IP address. See  [Figure 2](#fig41979345127).
