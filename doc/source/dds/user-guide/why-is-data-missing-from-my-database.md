# Why Is Data Missing from My Database?<a name="dds_faq_0007"></a>

DDS does not delete or perform any operations on any user data. If this problem occurs, check whether a misoperation has been performed. Restore the data using backup files, if necessary.

Solution:

-   Use the DDS restoration function to restore data. For details, see section  [Restoring a Cluster Instance from a Backup](restoring-a-cluster-instance-from-a-backup.md).
-   Import backups to DDS. For details, see section  [Migrating Data](migrating-data.md).
