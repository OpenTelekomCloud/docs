# Can an External Server Access the DDS DB Instance?<a name="dds_faq_0011"></a>

You can access the DDS DB instance using the following methods:

-   Create a DDS DB instance and an ECS in the same VPC to enable the ECS to access the instance.
-   If the DDS DB instance has an EIP assigned, you can access the instance through the EIP.
