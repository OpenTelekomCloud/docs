## Instant Availability<a name="section61491233144328"></a>

You can create a DB instance on the management console and access DDS through an Elastic Cloud Server \(ECS\) to reduce the application response time. If you need to access a DB instance from your local devices, you can bind an elastic IP address \(EIP\) to the instance.

## High Compatibility<a name="section11590950144344"></a>

DDS is a document-oriented  NoSQL database. It is fully compatible with  MongoDB.

## Easy O&M<a name="section43893088141312"></a>

You can easily perform restart, backup, and data recovery operations on instances using a graphical user interface \(GUI\)
