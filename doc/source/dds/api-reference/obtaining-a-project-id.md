# Obtaining a Project ID<a name="dds_projectid"></a>

When calling APIs, you need to specify the project ID in some URLs. To do so, you need to obtain the project ID first. Perform the following operations to obtain the project ID:

1.  Register yourself on the management console and log in to it.
2.  Move your pointer over the username and select  **My Credential**  in the displayed drop-down list.

    On the  **My Credential**  page, view the project ID in the project list.
