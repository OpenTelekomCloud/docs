# Application Scenarios<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0046252756"></a>

-   Industries that have high requirements for regulation compliance and security

    You can exclusively use and control a physical host which is physically isolated from resources of other users to achieve your high requirements for compliance and security.

-   Tenants that use the Bring Your Own License \(BYOL\) mode

    If you have an OS or a software license \(a license whose certified items include number of physical sockets and physical cores\), you can migrate your services to the cloud platform using the BYOL mode. Then, you can continue to use your existing licenses.

-   Industries that are extremely sensitive to performance and stability

    Compared with common services, some special services such as financial securities and game applications have higher requirements on server performance, stability, and real-time performance. DeHs can help you further improve the stability of service CPUs and network I/O resources to ensure a reliable running of applications.

-   **Independent resource deployment and flexible management**

    You can create ECSs on a specified DeH and specify your ECS specifications based on the type of DeH you specified. You can migrate an ECS from a DeH to another DeH or migrate an ECS from the public resource pool to a DeH.
