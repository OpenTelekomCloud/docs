-   ECSs automatically created by Auto Scaling \(AS\) will not be dispatched to DeHs. However, you are allowed to manually add the ECSs created on DeHs to the AS groups.
-   Special ECSs, such as those with local disks or GPUs, cannot be migrated between DeHs or between the public resource pool and DeHs.
