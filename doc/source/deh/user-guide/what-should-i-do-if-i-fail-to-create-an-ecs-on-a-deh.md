# What Should I Do If I Fail to Create an ECS on a DeH?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0047157947"></a>

The following may cause the failure in creating an ECS on a DeH: 

-   The ECS flavor you selected is not supported by your DeH.

    For the ECS flavors supported by each DeH type, see  [Overview](overview.md).

-   Your DeH resources are insufficient, resulting in failure in creating an ECS with the specifications you selected.

    You can check whether the remaining vCPU resources and memory size of your DeH are sufficient for creating an ECS with the specifications you selected. If the resources are insufficient, you need to apply for new DeH resources or delete some ECSs on your DeH.
