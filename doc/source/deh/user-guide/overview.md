A DeH flavor states the configuration information of its physical server, and it determines the series and number of ECSs you can create on the DeH.

The configuration information of the physical server working as a DeH includes the number of CPUs \(number of sockets\), number of physical cores, local storage, hardware configuration \(CPU model and memory size\), and number of vCPUs. You can specify DeH flavors based on your service features and scale.

Currently, the following DeH flavors are supported:

-   General-purpose DeHs
-   Dedicated general-purpose DeHs
-   Memory-optimized DeHs
-   High-performance DeHs
