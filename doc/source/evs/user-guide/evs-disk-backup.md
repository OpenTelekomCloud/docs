## What Is EVS Disk Backup<a name="section33621696191528"></a>

EVS implements the backup function through the Volume Backup Service \(VBS\). VBS allows you to create backups for EVS disks on the management console without stopping the server. When data loss or data damage occurred due to virus invasions, misoperations, or software and hardware faults, you can use backups to restore the data, guaranteeing your data correctness and security.

For details about EVS disk backup, see the  _Volume Backup Service User Guide_.

## Application Scenarios<a name="section8885956105220"></a>

The backup function helps address your following needs:

-   Set up the backup policy so that the EVS disk data can be automatically backed up based on the policy. You can use the backups created on a timely basis as the baseline data to create new EVS disks or to restore the backup data to EVS disks.
-   Share the backups with other tenants. You can use the backups shared by other tenants to create new EVS disks.
