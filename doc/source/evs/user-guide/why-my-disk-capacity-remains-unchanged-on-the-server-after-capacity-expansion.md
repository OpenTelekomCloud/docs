# Why My Disk Capacity Remains Unchanged on the Server After Capacity Expansion?<a name="evs_faq_0027"></a>

After expanding the disk capacity on the management console, you must log in to the server and extend the disk partition and file system for it to take effect. Otherwise, you cannot view the additional space on the server.

To extend disk partitions and file systems, see the following topics

-   [Extending Disk Partitions and File Systems \(Windows\)](extending-disk-partitions-and-file-systems-(windows).md)
-   [Partition and File System Extension Preparations \(Linux\)](partition-and-file-system-extension-preparations-(linux).md)
