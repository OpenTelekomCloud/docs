# Detaching a System Disk<a name="evs_01_0003"></a>

## Scenarios<a name="section21771672164455"></a>

A system disk can only be detached offline, that is, its server must be in the  **Stopped**  state before the system disk is detached. Therefore, you need to first stop the server and then detach the system disk.

For the system disk attached to a server, the disk function is displayed as  **System disk**, and the disk status is displayed as  **In-use**  in the disk list. After a system disk is detached from the server, the disk function changes to  **Bootable disk**, and the status changes to  **Available**.

>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>Bootable disks are the system disks detached from servers. A bootable disk can be re-attached to a server and be used as a system disk or data disk depending on the device name selected.
