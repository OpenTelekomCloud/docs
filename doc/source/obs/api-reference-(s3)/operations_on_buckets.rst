======================
Operations on Buckets
======================


The requests that are sent to OBS by users must comply with REST specifications and contain required header parameters. If a request is successfully processed, OBS returns a success response. If the request fails to be processed, OBS returns a message that contains the reason of the error. This chapter describes REST operations on buckets using the common header authorization. You can also use temporarily authorized requests described in section  [V2 Temporarily Authorized Request](v2-temporarily-authorized-request.md).
