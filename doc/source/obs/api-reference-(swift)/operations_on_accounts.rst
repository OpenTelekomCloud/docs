Operations on Accounts
======================

The requests that are sent by users to OBS \(compatible with OpenStack Swift\) must comply with REST specifications and contain required header parameters. If a request is successfully processed, OBS \(compatible with OpenStack Swift\) returns a success response. If the request fails to be processed, OBS \(compatible with OpenStack Swift\) returns a message that contains the cause of the error. This chapter describes REST operations on accounts \(with IAM authentication\).
