# What Is the Data Volume That I Can Store in OBS?<a name="obs_faq_0010"></a>

Both the OBS system and any single bucket have no restrictions on the total data capacity and the number of objects or files that can be stored. However, there are limitations for object upload.

-   The maximum size of a single object that can be uploaded through OBS Console is 50 MB.
-   If you upload an object through OBS Browser, or using the API and SDK, the maximum size of the object is 48.8 TB.
