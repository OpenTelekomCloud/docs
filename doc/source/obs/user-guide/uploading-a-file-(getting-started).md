# Uploading a File<a name="obs_03_0307"></a>

This section describes how to upload local files to OBS over the Internet. These files can be texts, images, videos, or any other type of files.

>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>You can upload a file of up to 50 MB using OBS Console.  
>If versioning is disabled and the name of a newly uploaded file is the same as that of a file in the bucket, the newly uploaded file automatically overwrites the existing file and does not retain the ACL information of the existing file. If the name of the newly uploaded folder is the same as that of a folder in the bucket, the two folders will be merged, and files in the new folder will overwrite namesake files in the old folder.  
>If versioning is enabled and the name of a newly uploaded file is the same as that of a file in the bucket, a new version is added to the existing file. For details about versioning, see  [Versioning Overview](versioning-overview.md).
