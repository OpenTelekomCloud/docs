# Can Folders in OBS Be Used the Same Way As Those in a File System?<a name="obs_faq_0016"></a>

No.

OBS does not involve the concept of files or folders like those in a file system. For easy data management, OBS provides a method to simulate folders. On OBS Console, you can simulate a folder by adding a slash \(/\) to the name of an object, which is then displayed as a folder.
