# Creating a Folder<a name="obs_03_0413"></a>

This section describes how to create a folder using OBS Browser.

## Background Information<a name="se3ee933427894ffdb670dce4fd51d3b7"></a>

Unlike the file system, OBS does not involve the concepts of file and folder. For easy data management, OBS provides a method to simulate folders. On OBS, an object is simulated as a folder by adding a slash \(/\) to the object name on OBS Browser.

## Procedure<a name="s65c969d1ffff4f1f8d512e8ed6acdfc7"></a>

1.  Log in to OBS Browser.
2.  Click the bucket in which you want to create a folder. Click  **Create Folder**.
3.  In the dialog box that is displayed, enter a folder name and click  **OK**.
    -   You can create single-level or multi-level folders.
    -   The name cannot contain the following special characters:  **\\:\*?"<\>|**
    -   The name cannot start or end with a period \(.\) or slash \(/\).
    -   The absolute path of the folder cannot exceed 1023 characters.
    -   Any single slash \(/\) separates and creates multiple levels of folders at once.
    -   Cannot contain two or more adjacent slashes \(/\).

4.  In the dialog box that is displayed, click  **OK**.
