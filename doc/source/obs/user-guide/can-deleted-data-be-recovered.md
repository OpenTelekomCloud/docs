# Can Deleted Data Be Recovered?<a name="obs_03_0139"></a>

If the versioning function is enabled for a bucket, deleted objects are saved to the  **Deleted Objects**  list. You can recover objects from the  **Deleted Objects**  list. For details, see  [Undeleting a File](undeleting-a-file.md).

If the versioning function is not enabled, deleted objects cannot be recovered.
