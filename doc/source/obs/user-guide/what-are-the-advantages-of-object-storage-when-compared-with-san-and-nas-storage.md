# What Are the Advantages of Object Storage When Compared with SAN and NAS Storage?<a name="obs_faq_0006"></a>

-   SAN storage provides LUNs or volumes for applications. LUNs and volumes are organization forms of disk space. Upper-layer applications use the Fibre Channel or iSCSI protocol to access the SAN storage. SAN storage focuses on disk management. For other purposes, SAN storage must rely on upper-layer applications.
-   NAS storage provides file systems or folders for applications. Upper-layer applications use the NFS or CIFS protocol to access the NAS storage. Directory trees of file systems must be maintained.
-   Object storage is suitable for web applications. A massive bucket storage space is provided based on a URL address to store a wide range of file objects. Object storage adopts a flat architecture. Users do not need to maintain complex file directories. There is no need to worry about insufficient storage space because the storage space of a bucket is almost infinite.
