## Comparison Between OBS and On-Premises Storage Servers<a name="section1071910168165"></a>

In this information era, it becomes increasingly difficult for conventional on-premises storage servers to deal with enterprises' explosive data growth.  [Table 1](#table3469342151617)  details a comprehensive comparison between OBS and on-premises storage servers.

## OBS Advantages<a name="section156154701515"></a>

-   **Reliable data durability and service continuity**: OBS supports access for hundreds of millions of users.
-   **Multi-level protection and authorization management**: The multiple data protection mechanisms, including versioning, server-side encryption, uniform resource locator \(URL\) validation, virtual private cloud \(VPC\)-based network isolation, access log audit, and fine-grained permission control, ensure persistent data security.
-   **Unlimited number of objects and high-level concurrency**: With intelligent scheduling and response, optimized data access paths, and technologies such as event notification, transmission acceleration, and big data vertical optimization, you can store hundreds of billions of objects in OBS, and still experience smooth concurrency of hundreds of billions of tasks, ultra-high bandwidth, and low latency.
-   **Easy to use and manage**: OBS provides standard REST APIs, SDKs that support multiple programming languages, and data migration tools, such as OBS Browser to help you quickly move your services to the cloud. You do not need to plan storage capacity beforehand or worry about storage capacity expansion or reduction, because storage resources are available for linear and nearly infinite expansion.
