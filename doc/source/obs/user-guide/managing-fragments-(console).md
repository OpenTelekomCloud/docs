# Managing Fragments<a name="en-us_topic_0045853514"></a>

## Background Information<a name="section30580753"></a>

Fragments are generated when multipart upload tasks fail. Such failures generally occur in the following scenarios:

-   The network is in poor condition, and the connection to the OBS server is interrupted frequently.
-   The upload task is manually suspended.
-   The device is faulty.
-   The device is powered off suddenly.

On OBS Console, storage used by fragments is charged. Clear fragments when they are not needed. If a file upload task fails, upload the file again.

>Fragments on OBS consume storage spaces that are charged according to price rates of storage space.
