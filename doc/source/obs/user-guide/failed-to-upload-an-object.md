# Failed to Upload an Object<a name="obs_faq_0134"></a>

-   Check whether the network connectivity is normal between the local computer and OBS. If the network is down, restore the network connection.
-   If a message indicating "service unavailable" is displayed when objects are being uploaded, try again later.
-   Check whether the account is in arrears or the account balance is insufficient. If it is the case, top up the account.
-   Check whether the account has the permission to upload objects. The check scope includes the  IAM policies, bucket policies, and bucket ACLs. If you do not have the permission, obtain the permission first.
-   For OBS Browser, the database disorder may cause the upload failure. You can clear the database and upload the file again.

    Delete all files in the  [database path](tasks-are-not-displayed-in-the-task-list-when-objects-are-managed-using-obs-browser.md).

-   If the fault persists, contact the customer service personnel.
