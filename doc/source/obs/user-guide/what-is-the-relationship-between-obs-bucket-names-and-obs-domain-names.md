# What Is the Relationship Between OBS Bucket Names and OBS Domain Names?<a name="obs_faq_0123"></a>

An OBS bucket name is the name of the bucket you created.

The domain name is the endpoint of the region where the bucket is located.

The bucket name plus the regional domain name \(_bucket name.domain name_\) can form the access domain name of your OBS bucket.
