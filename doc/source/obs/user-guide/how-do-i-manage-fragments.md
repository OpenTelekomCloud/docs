# How Do I Manage Fragments?<a name="obs_faq_0046"></a>

Fragments on OBS consume storage spaces that are charged according to price rates of storage space.

You can clear the fragments in a bucket on the OBS Console or OBS Browser.

If fragments are generated due to interruptions of multipart upload tasks on OBS Browser, they will disappear once those tasks are finished.
