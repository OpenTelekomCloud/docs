# Task Management<a name="obs_03_0435"></a>

OBS Browser supports the management of upload, download, deletion, and restoration tasks. You can suspend, cancel, or delete tasks using the task management function.

>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>If the number of displayed items exceeds 200,000, the system will save the first 100,000 items of tasks that are created earlier to the  **history**  directory in the decompression path of OBS Browser. These items are saved in the  **historyDBData**\[_time stamp_\]**.csv**  files, for example,  **historyDBData20170426T063744.csv**.
