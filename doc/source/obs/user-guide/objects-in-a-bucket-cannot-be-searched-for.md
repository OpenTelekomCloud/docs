# Objects in a Bucket Cannot Be Searched For<a name="obs_faq_0136"></a>

On OBS Console and OBS Browser, you can search for objects by object name prefix. For example, if you search for  **test**, the search results are the objects whose names start with the prefix of  **test**. If the key word entered is not the name prefix of the object that you want to search for, the search fails. For example, the name of the object to be searched for is  **testabc**  and you enter  **abc**  in the search box, the  **testabc**  object cannot be found. Only objects whose names start with the prefix  **abc**  are searched.
