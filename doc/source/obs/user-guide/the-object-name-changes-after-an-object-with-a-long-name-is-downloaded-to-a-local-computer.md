# The Object Name Changes After an Object with a Long Name Is Downloaded to a Local Computer<a name="obs_03_0345"></a>

## Question<a name="section54133615"></a>

After an object with a relatively long name is downloaded to a local path, the object name changes.

## Answer<a name="section17440495"></a>

For Windows, a file name, including the file name extension, can contain a maximum of 255 characters. When an object with a name containing more than 255 characters is downloaded to a local computer, the system keeps only the first 255 characters automatically.
