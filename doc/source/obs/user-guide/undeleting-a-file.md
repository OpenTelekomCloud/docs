## Background Information<a name="section1131791617239"></a>

**Object deletion philosophy when versioning is enabled**

OBS adopts different deletion methods for different objects when versioning is enabled.

-   Deleting a file or folder does not delete it permanently. The deleted file or folder will be retained in the  **Deleted Objects**  list and marked with the  **Delete Marker**.
    -   If you want to delete the file or folder permanently, you need to delete it from the  **Deleted Objects**  list. For details, see  [Deleting a File or Folder](deleting-a-file-(console).md).
    -   To recover a deleted file, you can cancel the deletion by the  **Undelete**  operation. For details, see  [Procedure](#section50464659154530)  in this section.

-   Deleting a version of an object will permanently delete that version. If the deleted version is the latest one, the next latest version becomes the latest version.

**Object recovery philosophy when versioning is enabled**

When a bucket has the versioning function enabled, deleting a file from the  **Objects**  list does not permanently delete it. The deleted file will be retained with the  **Delete Marker**  in the  **Deleted Objects**  list. You can recover a deleted object by the  **Undelete**  operation.

When performing the  **Undelete**  operation, note the following points:

1.  You can only  **Undelete**  deleted files but not folders.

    After you  **Undelete**  a deleted file, the file is recovered and will appear in the  **Objects**  list. Then you can perform basic operations on the file as you normally do on other objects. If the file was stored in a folder before the deletion, it will be recovered to its original path after you  **Undelete**  it.

2.  Deleted files in the  **Deleted Objects**  also have multiple versions. When deleting different versions of files, note the following points:
    -   If you delete a version with the  **Delete Marker**, it actually recovers that specific version instead of permanently deleting it. For details, see  [Follow-up Procedure](#section27691114163422).
    -   If you delete a version without the  **Delete Marker**, that specific version is deleted permanently. Even if the object is recovered later, this version will not be recovered.

3.  At least one version without the  **Delete Marker**  exists in the  **Deleted Objects**  list. Otherwise, the deletion cannot be canceled.
