# Time Difference Is Longer Than 15 Minutes Between the Client and Server<a name="obs_03_0347"></a>

## Question<a name="section25136147"></a>

OBS is unavailable when an error is reported stating "Time difference is longer than 15 minutes between the client and server."

## Answer<a name="section24898733"></a>

For security purposes, the system checks the time difference between the management console and the server. If the time difference is greater than 15 minutes, this error is reported. Adjust the local time based on the UTC time to avoid this problem.
