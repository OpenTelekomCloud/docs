# Uploading a File with Server-Side Encryption<a name="obs_03_0322"></a>

OBS allows users to encrypt objects using server-side encryption so that the objects can be securely stored in OBS.

## Limitations and Constraints<a name="section4247191810406"></a>

-   The object encryption status cannot be changed.
-   A key in use cannot be deleted. Otherwise, the object encrypted with this key cannot be downloaded.

## Prerequisites<a name="s0d643ba8bc99487da02b86a7664d2605"></a>

In the region where OBS is deployed, the  **KMS Administrator**  permission has been added to the user group. For details about how to add permissions, see the  _IAM User Guide_.

## Procedure<a name="section16043441174915"></a>

1.  In the bucket list, click the bucket to be operated. The  **Overview**  page of the bucket is displayed.
2.  In the navigation pane on the left, click  **Objects**.
3.  Click  **Upload Object**. The  **Upload Object**  dialog box is displayed.
4.  Select the file that you want to upload and click  **Open**.
5.  Select  **KMS encryption**  and select a key that you have created on KMS.

    After  **KMS encryption**  is selected,  **obs/default**  is selected by default as the key for the encryption. You can also click  **Create KMS Key**  to switch to the management console of KMS and create customer master keys. Then back to OBS Console and select the key from the drop-down list box for KMS encryption.
