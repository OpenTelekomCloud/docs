>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>-   Objects can be changed from the  **Standard**  storage class to  **Warm**  or  **Cold**  storage class. Objects can be changed from the  **Warm**  storage class to  **Standard**  or  **Cold**  storage class. Objects of the  **Cold**  storage class must be restored before being changed to  **Standard**  or  **Warm**  storage class. The latter two changes incur penalty and restoration fees. Determine an appropriate change path based on your actual needs.  
>-   When the storage class is changed to Cold, the object restoration status changes to  **Unrestored**.  
>-   You can also configure a lifecycle rule to change the storage class of an object. For details, see  [Lifecycle Management Overview](lifecycle-management-overview-(browser).md).
