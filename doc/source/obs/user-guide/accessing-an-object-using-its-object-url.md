# Accessing an Object Using Its Object URL<a name="obs_03_0416"></a>

The object uniform resource locator \(URL\) \(object sharing\) function allows anonymous users to access object data using object URLs.

## Prerequisites<a name="s4ecf44968672497286abe0738d6b2171"></a>

An anonymous user has been assigned with the permission to read the specified object. For details, see  [Configuring Object ACL](configuring-object-acl.md).

## Procedure<a name="sd8bcdd98f0554dc48154e4f9625aa3c7"></a>

1.  Log in to OBS Browser.
2.  Click the bucket to be operated.
3.  Click the bucket for which you want to configure the object URL function, and click  ![](figures/icon-attributes.png)  next to the object to be shared to view the object URL. For details, see  [Figure 1](#fe095887a5e664d6aa0dd30456edda8b1).

    -   If you select  **Other object storage services**  when logging in to OBS Browser, the object URL is in the format of https://_storage server IP address_  or  _domain name_/_bucket name_/_directory level_/_object name_. If the object is in the root directory of the bucket, the URL does not contain a  _directory level_.
    -   If you select  **OBS**  when logging in to OBS Browser, the object URL is in the format of https://_bucket name.domain name_/_directory level_/_object name._  If the object is in the root directory of the bucket, the URL does not contain a  _directory level_.

    >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >To allow anonymous users to access objects stored in a bucket of Cold storage class using the URL, ensure that the objects are in the  **Restored**  state.  
    >The method of using a browser to access objects varies depending on the object type. You can directly open  **.txt**  and  **.html**  files using a browser. However, when you open  **.exe**  and  **.dat**  files using a browser, the files are automatically downloaded to your local computer.  

4.  Click  **Copy**  to copy the URL of the object.
5.  In the displayed dialog box, click  **Close**  to close the dialog box.
6.  Paste the object URL in the address box of a web browser. Press  **Enter**, and then you can access the object.
