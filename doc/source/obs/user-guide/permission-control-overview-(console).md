OBS supports the following permission control mechanisms:

-   IAM policies:  IAM policies  define the actions that can be performed on your cloud resources. In other words,  IAM policies  specify what actions are allowed or denied.
-   Bucket policy and object policy:

    A bucket policy applies to the configured OBS bucket and objects in the bucket. An OBS bucket owner can use a bucket policy to grant permissions of buckets and objects in the buckets to IAM users or other accounts.

    An object policy applies to specified objects in a bucket.

-   Access Control List \(ACL\): OBS provides ACL settings at bucket and object levels. Bucket and object ACLs are attached to accounts.
