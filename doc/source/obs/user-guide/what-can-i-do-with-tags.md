# What Can I Do with Tags?<a name="obs_03_0040"></a>

If you add tags to a bucket, charging data records \(CDRs\) generated by the requests for this bucket will be added with these tags, so that you can use the tags to classify CDRs for detailed cost analysis. For example, if a running application uploads data to a bucket, you can tag the bucket with the application name. In this manner, the costs on the application can be analyzed using tags on CDRs.
