You can delete BMSs you no longer need. 

After a BMS is deleted, it is still displayed in the BMS list for a short period of time, after which it will be deleted from the BMS list. Tags and disks of the BMS will be disassociated from the BMS, and data on the disks will be deleted.

## Procedure<a name="section386325812919"></a>

1.  Log in to the management console. 
2.  Under  **Computing**, click  **Bare Metal Server**.

    The BMS console is displayed.

3.  Locate the row that contains the target BMS, click  **More**  in the  **Operation**  column, and select  **Delete**  from the drop-down list. To delete multiple BMSs, select them and click  **Delete**  at the top of the BMS list.
4.  In the displayed dialog box, click  **Yes**.

    If the BMS has associated resources, such as EVS disks and EIP, you can choose whether to delete these resources.
