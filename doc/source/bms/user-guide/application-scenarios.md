## Security-Demanding Scenario<a name="section5646132913306"></a>

Financial and securities industries have compliance requirements, and some customers have strict data security requirements. The BMS service ensures exclusive, dedicated resource use, data isolation, as well as operation monitoring and tracking.

## High-Performance Computing Scenario<a name="section8449162015320"></a>

High-performance computing, such as the supercomputer center and genome sequencing, needs to process a large amount of data. Therefore, these scenarios have high computing performance, stability, and timeliness requirements. BMSs can meet your high-performance computing requirements. With BMSs, you do not need to worry about performance overheads caused by virtualization and hyperthreading. 

## Core Database Scenario<a name="section1255682123213"></a>

Some key database services cannot be deployed on VMs and must be deployed on physical servers that have dedicated resources, isolated networks, and assured performance. The BMS service provides high-performance servers dedicated for individual users, meeting user requirements in this scenario.
