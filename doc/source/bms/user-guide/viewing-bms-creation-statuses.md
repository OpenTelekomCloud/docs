# Viewing BMS Creation Statuses<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0053536924"></a>

## **Scenarios**<a name="section49701611171023"></a>

After clicking  **Submit**  to request a BMS, you can query the task status in the  **Task Status**  area. A task involves several sub-tasks, such as creating a BMS resource, binding an EIP, and attaching an EVS disk.

The task status may be either  **Creating**  or  **Failed**:

-   **Processing**: The system is processing the task.
-   **Failed**: The system has failed to process the task. The system rolls back the failed task and displays an error code, for example,  **\(BMS.3033\) Failed to create system disk**.

This section describes how to query BMS application processing status and the information displayed in the  **Task Status**  area.

## **Procedure**<a name="section40936232171845"></a>

2.  Under  **Computing**, click  **Bare Metal Server**.

    The BMS console is displayed.

3.  **Task Status**  is displayed on the right of common operations, such as  **Start**,  **Stop**,  **Restart**, and  **Delete**. After you apply for a BMS, the  **Task Status**  area will show the task processing status.
