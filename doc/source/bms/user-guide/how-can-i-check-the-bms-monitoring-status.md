# How Can I Check the BMS Monitoring Status?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0081402281"></a>

The BMS monitoring software is installed in the  **/usr/local/telescope**  directory. Logs are in the  **/usr/local/telescope/log/**  directory, in which  **ces.log**  is the data log and  **common.log**  is the run log.

-   If data is not sent successfully and  **403**  or  **401**  is returned, check whether  **AccessKey**  and  **SecretKey**  are specified correctly.
-   If data is not sent successfully and  **500**  or other codes are returned, contact the customer service.
