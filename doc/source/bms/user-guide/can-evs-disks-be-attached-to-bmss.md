# Can EVS Disks Be Attached to BMSs? <a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0053536912"></a>

Yes. BMSs support ultra-high I/O, high I/O, and common I/O EVS disks. 

>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>If you need to attach an EVS disk to an existing BMS,  **Device Type**  of the EVS disk must be  **SCSI**  \(SCSI-3 disk is supported\). If you need to create an EVS disk and attach it to the BMS, you must select  **SCSI**  for  **Device Type**  on the page for creating the EVS disk.
