BMSs provide both the stability of traditional physical servers and the high scalability of cloud resources. BMSs meet your requirements for high-performance computing and help you build hybrid clouds. Bare Metal Servers \(BMSs\) have all the features and advantages of physical servers and support secondary virtualization.

## Advantages<a name="section1070317206440"></a>

-   Easing your concern about migrating services to the cloud

    You need to use computing resources of various types and forms in the cloud. Only a combination of physical servers and VMs, instead of VMs alone, can meet requirements in complex application scenarios. Some special application scenarios have high requirements on host performance and stability, or have strict requirements on data security and supervision. VMs cannot meet customer requirements and exclusively used physical servers are required. AnyStack on BMS provides you with a more reliable, comprehensive, and flexible way to migrate your services to the cloud.

-   Enhancing your sense of security

    Some enterprises have successful experience in virtualization services deployed in private cloud data centers and have many talents in virtualization. When migrating services to the public cloud, these enterprises attach great importance to security and transformation of their talent skills. With AnyStack on BMS, you can smoothly migrate VMs, service load, or your data center to the public cloud without making any change to your services, personnel skills, or existing O&M tools and experience.

-   Providing more flexible load distribution and quicker service expansion

    Service VMs running on BMSs can access various public cloud products, including computing, database, monitoring, and security services. Expanding and reducing the host capacity takes as less as several minutes, making it easy to develop services fast and meet demands in peak and off-peak periods. In the public cloud environment, different workload is processed separately. Infrastructure resources are scalable to cope with burst traffic. Using public cloud resources for DR and backup ensures service data security and reliability.
