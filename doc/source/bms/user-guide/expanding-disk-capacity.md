# Expanding Disk Capacity<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0102427989"></a>

If a disk does not have sufficient capacity, you can expand its capacity. Both the system disk and data disk can be expanded. The maximum size of a system disk is 1 TB. For details about how to expand the disk capacity, see "Expanding the Capacity of an EVS Disk".

After the capacity expansion is successful, allocate the partition for the extended space of the DSS disk.

-   For details about follow-up operations after a system disk is expanded, see the "Expanding an Existing Partition" part in section "Performing Post-Expansion Operations for a Linux EVS Disk \(fdisk\)" or the "Expanding an Existing Partition" part in section "Performing Post-Expansion Operations for a Linux EVS Disk \(parted\)" in  _Elastic Volume Service User Guide_.
-   For details about the follow-up operations after a data disk is expanded, see "**Performing Post-Expansion Operations for a Linux SCSI Data Disk \(fdisk\)**" in  _Elastic Volume Service User Guide_.
