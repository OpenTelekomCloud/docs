## Introduction<a name="section54689666195031"></a>

DIS can upload data to Object Storage Service \(OBS\).

## Prerequisites<a name="section44362682195133"></a>

An IAM agency has been created by following the procedure in  [Creating an IAM Agency](creating-an-iam-agency.md). This IAM agency entrusts DIS to access your OBS resources.

## Data Dumping<a name="section15729224195053"></a>

In section  [Creating a Dump Task](creating-a-dump-task.md), you can select a location to which data from DIS streams will be dumped. If Dump Destination is set to  **OBS**, DIS periodically imports data from DIS streams to OBS.
