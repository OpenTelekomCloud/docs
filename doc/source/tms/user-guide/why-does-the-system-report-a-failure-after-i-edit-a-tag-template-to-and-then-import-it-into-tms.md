# Why Does the System Report a Failure After I Edit a Tag Template to and Then Import It Into TMS?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0141727055"></a>

TMS does not support tag templates that have been edited in Excel, and doing so may result in the system reporting a failure. You must use another application, such as Text, to edit tag templates.
