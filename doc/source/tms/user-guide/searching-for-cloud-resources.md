Before adding tags, you must search for available cloud resources. Cloud resource tags will be displayed on the TMS console where you can manage them, including adding, deleting, and modifying tags.

TMS provides the following search criteria:

-   **Region**
-   **Resource Type**
-   \(Optional\)  **Resource Tag**
    -   You can search for up to 20 tags at a time.
    -   If you need to search for specified tags, entering a key is mandatory but entering a value is optional. You can add 9 values for each key.
    -   When you specify the search criteria, the cloud resources you want to search for must meet all of the key criteria and at least one of the value criteria.

-   **\(Optional\)** **Search Without Tags**
    -   You can search for resources without any tags.
