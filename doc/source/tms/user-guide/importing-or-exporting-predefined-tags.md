If you have inventory tags, you can quickly import them to the TMS predefined tags to facilitate subsequent resource association.

The predefined tag import function allows you to import the .csv file exported from a third party to TMS. The encoding format of the .csv file must be UTF-8.

If duplicate content exists between the current environment and the imported file, the content of the current environment will be overwritten after the import.

When editing tags to be imported, pay attention to the following restrictions:

-   Each user can create up to 500 predefined tags.
-   You can enter a maximum of 36 and 43 characters for  **Key**  and  **Value**, respectively. Both  **Key**  and  **Value**  can contain only digits, letters, hyphens \(-\), at signs \(@\), and underscores \(\_\).
