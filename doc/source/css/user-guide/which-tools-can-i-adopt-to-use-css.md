# Which Tools Can I Adopt to Use CSS?<a name="css_02_0017"></a>

You can use any of the following three methods to manage CSS or to use search engine APIs. You can initiate requests based on constructed request messages.

-   cURL

    cURL is a command-line tool used to perform URL operations and transfer information. It serves as the HTTP client that can send HTTP requests to the HTTP server and receive response messages. cURL is suitable for use in API tuning scenarios. For more information about cURL, visit  [https://curl.haxx.se/](https://curl.haxx.se/).

-   Code

    You can invoke APIs through code to assemble, send, and process request messages.

-   REST client

    Both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome provide a graphical browser plugin, that is, REST client, to send and process requests. 

    – For Mozilla Firefox, see  [Firefox REST Client](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/).

    – For Google Chrome, see  [Postman Interceptor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo?hl=en).
