# What Is the Upper Limit for the Storage Capacity of CSS?<a name="css_02_0009"></a>

You can create 1 to 32 nodes during cluster creation. A certain number of disks are mounted to each node, which corresponds to an ECS. You can calculate the total storage capacity of CSS based on the sizes of EVS disks attached to different ECSs. For details about the limitation on EVS disk sizes, see  [Restrictions](restrictions.md).
