# Which Storage Options Does CSS Provide?<a name="css_02_0008"></a>

CSS uses Elastic Volume Service \(EVS\) disks to store your indices. During cluster creation, you can specify the EVS disk type and specifications \(that is, the EVS disk size\).

-   Supported EVS disk types include common I/O \(SATA disk\), high I/O \(SAS disk\), and ultra-high I/O \(SSD\).
-   For details about the sizes of EVS disks for different ECSs, see  [Restrictions](restrictions.md).
