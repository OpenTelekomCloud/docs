# Why Do I Fail to Create a Cluster?<a name="css_02_0028"></a>

The possible causes of a cluster creation failure are as follows:

-   Insufficient resource quota. You are advised to apply for sufficient resource quotas. For details, see  [How Can I Apply for a Higher Quota?](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/faq/iaas/en-us_topic_0040259342.html)
-   The value of  **Port Range/ICMP Type**  in  **Security Group**  does not include port  **9200**. Modify the security group information or select another available security group.
