# Creating a Full-ECS Image from a CSBS Backup<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0093344231"></a>

## Scenarios<a name="section1363113095818"></a>

You can use a  CSBS backup  to create a  full-ECS  image, which can be used to create ECSs.

>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>-   For how to create a CSBS backup, see  _Cloud Server Backup Service User Guide_.  
>-   After a full-ECS image is deleted, the associated CSBS backup will not be deleted. To delete the associated backup, go to the CSBS console.  

## Constraints<a name="section4442765619267"></a>

-   When creating a full-ECS image from a CSBS backup, ensure that the ECS corresponding to the CSBS backup has been properly configured. Otherwise, creating ECSs using the full-ECS image may fail.
-   A CSBS backup used to create a full-ECS image cannot have shared disks.
-   Only an available CSBS backup can be used to create a full-ECS image. A CSBS backup can be used to create only one full-ECS image.
-   A full-ECS image cannot be shared with other tenants.
-   A full-ECS image cannot be published as a Marketplace image.
-   A full-ECS image cannot be exported or replicated.
