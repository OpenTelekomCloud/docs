## Why Is Sysprep Required?<a name="section333192292817"></a>

For a user that needs to be added to the domain and uses the domain account to log in to Windows, the Sysprep operation is required before creating private images. Otherwise, the image will contain information about the original ECS, especially the SID. ECSs with the same SID cannot be added to a domain. If Windows does not require any user or ECS to be added to the domain, you do not need to run Sysprep.

## Restrictions on Running Sysprep<a name="section78101353192812"></a>

Due to OS limitations, Sysprep can only be used for configuring a new Windows installation. You can run Sysprep multiple times to install and configure Windows. However, you can reset and activate Windows OS only three times, and you are not allowed to use Sysprep to re-configure the existing Windows OS.

>In the Windows command line, enter the following command to check how many times you can run Sysprep in the displayed  **Windows Script Host**  dialog box:  
>**slmgr /dlv**  
>If the value of  **Remaining Windows rearm count**  is  **0**, you cannot run Sysprep.
