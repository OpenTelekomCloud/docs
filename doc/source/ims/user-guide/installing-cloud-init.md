# Installing Cloud-Init<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0030730603"></a>

## Scenarios<a name="en-us_topic_0029124518_section2104193419393"></a>

To ensure that you can use the user data injection function to inject initial custom information into ECSs created from a private image \(such as setting the ECS login password\), install Cloud-Init on the ECS used to create the image.

-   You need to download  Cloud-Init  from its official website. Therefore, you must bind an EIP to the ECS.
-   If Cloud-Init is not installed, you cannot configure an ECS. As a result, you can only use the password in the image file to log in to the ECS.
-   By default, ECSs created from a public image have Cloud-Init installed. You do not need to install and configure Cloudbase-Init on such ECSs.
-   For ECSs created using external image files, install and configure Cloud-Init by performing the operations in this section. For how to configure Cloud-Init, see  [Configuring Cloud-Init](configuring-cloud-init.md).

## Prerequisites<a name="en-us_topic_0029124518_section49653222162416"></a>

-   An EIP has been bound to the ECS.
-   You have logged in to the ECS.
-   The IP address obtaining mode of the ECS is DHCP.

## Procedure<a name="section62254326101255"></a>

1.  Check whether Cloud-Init has been installed.

    For details, see  [Check Whether Cloud-Init Has Been Installed](#section57525650153449).

2.  Install Cloud-Init.

    You can install Cloud-Init using either of the following methods:  [\(Recommended\) Install Cloud-Init Using the Official Installation Package](#section9013470154018)  and  [Install Cloud-Init Using the Official Source Code Package and pip](#section124220553610).


## Check Whether Cloud-Init Has Been Installed<a name="section57525650153449"></a>

Perform the operations provided here to check whether Cloud-Init has been installed.

The methods of checking whether Cloud-Init is installed vary depending on the OSs. Take CentOS 6 as an example. Run the following command to check whether Cloud-Init is installed:

**rpm -qa |grep cloud-init**

If information similar to the following is displayed, Cloud-Init has been installed:

```
cloud-init-0.7.5-10.el6.centos.2.x86_64
```

If Cloud-Init has been installed, perform the following operations:

-   Check whether to use the certificate in the ECS OS. If the certificate is no longer used, delete it.
    -   If the certificate is stored in a directory of user  **root**, for example,  _/$path/$to/$root_**/.ssh/authorized\_keys**, run the following commands:

        **cd /root/.ssh**

        **rm authorized\_keys**

    -   If the certificate is not stored in a directory of user  **root**, for example,  _/$path/$to/$none-root_**/.ssh/authorized\_keys**, run the following commands:

        **cd /home/centos/.ssh**

        **rm authorized\_keys**


-   Run the following command to delete the cache generated by Cloud-Init and ensure that the ECS created from the private image can be logged in by using the certificate:

    **sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cloud/\***


>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>Do not restart the ECS after performing the configuration. Otherwise, you need to configure it again.  

## \(Recommended\) Install Cloud-Init Using the Official Installation Package<a name="section9013470154018"></a>

The method of installing Cloud-Init on an ECS varies depending on the OS. Perform the installation operations as user  **root**.

The following describes how to install Cloud-Init on ECSs running SUSE Linux, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu. For other types of OS, install the required type of Cloud-Init. For example, you need to install coreos-cloudinit on ECSs running CoreOS.

-   SUSE Linux

    Paths for obtaining the Cloud-Init installation package for SUSE Linux

    >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >Select the required repo installation package in the provided paths.  

    Take SUSE Enterprise Linux Server 12 as an example. Perform the following steps to install Cloud-Init:

    1.  Log in to the ECS used to create a Linux private image.
    2.  Run the following command to install the network installation source for SUSE Enterprise Linux Server 12:

        **zypper ar http://ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/repositories/Cloud:/Tools/SLE\_12/Cloud:Tools.repo**

    3.  Run the following command to update the network installation source:

        **zypper refresh**

    4.  Run the following command to install Cloud-Init:

        **zypper install cloud-init**

    5.  Run the following commands to enable Cloud-Init to automatically start upon system boot:

        -   SUSE 11

            **chkconfig cloud-init-local on; chkconfig cloud-init on; chkconfig cloud-config on; chkconfig cloud-final on**

            **service cloud-init-local status; service cloud-init status; service cloud-config status; service cloud-final status**

        -   SUSE 12 and openSUSE 12/13/42

            **systemctl enable cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

            **systemctl status cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

        >![](/images/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:**   
        >For SUSE and openSUSE, perform the following steps to disable dynamic change of the ECS name:  
        >1.  Run the following command to open the  **dhcp**  file using the vi editor:  
        >    **vi** **etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp**  
        >2.  Change the value of  **DHCLIENT\_SET\_HOSTNAME**  in the  **dhcp**  file to  **no**.

The following operations use Cloud-Init 0.7.9 as an example to describe how to install Cloud-Init.

1.  Download the  **cloud-init-0.7.9.tar.gz**  source code package \(version 0.7.9 is recommended\) and upload it to the  **/home/**  directory of the ECS.

    Download  **cloud-init-0.7.9.tar.gz**  from the following path:

    [https://launchpad.net/cloud-init/trunk/0.7.9/+download/cloud-init-0.7.9.tar.gz](https://launchpad.net/cloud-init/trunk/0.7.9/+download/cloud-init-0.7.9.tar.gz)

2.  Create a  **pip.conf**  file in the  **\~/.pip/**  directory and edit the following content:

    >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >If the  **\~/.pip/**  directory does not exist, run the  **mkdir \~/.pip**  command to create it.  

    ```
    [global]
    index-url  = https://<$mirror>/simple/
    trusted-host = <$mirror>
    ```

    >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >Replace  _<$mirror\>_  with a public network PyPI source.  
    >Public network PyPI source:  [https://pypi.python.org/](https://pypi.python.org/)  

3.  Run the following command to install the downloaded Cloud-Init source code package \(select  **--upgrade**  as required during installation\):

    **pip install \[--upgrade\] /home/cloud-init-0.7.9.tar.gz**

4.  Run the  **cloud-init -v**  command. Cloud-Init is installed successfully if the following information is displayed:

    ```
    cloud-init 0.7.9
    ```

5.  Enable Cloud-Init to automatically start upon system boot.
    -   If the OS uses SysVinit to manage automatic start of services, run the following commands:

        **chkconfig --add cloud-init-local; chkconfig --add cloud-init; chkconfig --add cloud-config; chkconfig --add cloud-final**

        **chkconfig cloud-init-local on; chkconfig cloud-init on; chkconfig cloud-config on; chkconfig cloud-final on**

        **service cloud-init-local status; service cloud-init status; service cloud-config status; service cloud-final status**

    -   If the OS uses Systemd to manage automatic start of services, run the following commands:

        **systemctl enable cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

        **systemctl status cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**



>![](/images/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:**   
>If you install Cloud-Init using the official source code package and pip, pay attention to the following:  
>1.  Add user  **syslog**  to the  **adm**  group during the installation. If user  **syslog**  exists, add it to the  **adm**  group. For some OSs \(such as CentOS and SUSE\), user  **syslog**  may not exist. Run the following commands to create user  **syslog**  and add it to the  **adm**  group:  
>    **useradd syslog**  
>    **groupadd adm**  
>2.  Change the value of  **distro**  in  **system\_info**  in the  **/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg**  file based on the OS release version, such as  **distro: ubuntu**,  **distro: sles**,  **distro: debian**, and  **distro: fedora**.
