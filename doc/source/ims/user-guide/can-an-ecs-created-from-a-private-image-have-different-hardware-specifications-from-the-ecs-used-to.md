# Can an ECS Created from a Private Image Have Different Hardware Specifications from the ECS Used to Create the Private Image?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0030713209"></a>

When you use a private image to create an ECS, you can specify the system disk size of the ECS. However, the disk size must be greater than or equal to the system disk size of the image and less than 1024 GB. However, specifications of the CPU, memory, bandwidth, and data disk specifications can be different if necessary.
