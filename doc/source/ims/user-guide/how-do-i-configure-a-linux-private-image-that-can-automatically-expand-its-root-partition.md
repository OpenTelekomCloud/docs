# How Do I Configure a Linux Private Image That Can Automatically Expand Its Root Partition?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0076880304"></a>

## Constraints<a name="section38936340165553"></a>

-   An image whose root partition file system is xfs cannot automatically expand its partitions.
-   An image that has the LVM partition cannot automatically expand its partitions.
-   Images whose file system is ext3 or ext4 are recommended.

    >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >After OS partitions of old versions are expanded, the OS must be restarted to update the file system.  


## Installation of growpart on Different OSs<a name="section9252000155656"></a>

## Procedure<a name="section4041293916641"></a>

Take the following as two examples of image disk partitioning:

If the root partition is the last partition, see  [Root partition at the last](#li38782413161354).

If the root partition is not the last partition, see  [Root partition not at the last](#li17770807112053).

>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>If the  **parted**  command fails, ensure that the  **parted**  tool has been installed on the OS. Perform the following operations to install the tool:  
>-   For CentOS, run the following command:  
>    **yum install parted**  
>-   For Debian, run the following command:  
>    **apt-get install parted**  

-   <a name="li38782413161354"></a>Root partition at the last \(**/dev/xvda1: swap**  and  **/dev/xvda2: root**\)

    For example, if the system disk size of CentOS 6.5 64-bit is 40 GB, perform the following operations to configure a Linux private image that can automatically expand its root partition:

    1.  Run the following command to query the partitions of  **/dev/xvda**:

        **parted -l /dev/xvda**

        As shown in the command output, the root partition is the second partition and is 38.7 GB.

        ```
        Model: Xen Virtual Block Device (xvd)
        Disk /dev/xvda: 42.7GB
        Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
        Partition Table: msdos
        
        Number Start End Size Type File system Flags

        2 4296MB 42.9GB 38.7GB primary ext4 boot
        ```

    2.  Install growpart to ensure that the image can automatically expand its root partition.

        Run the following command to install growpart:

        **yum install_ _cloud-\***

        >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
        >growpart may be contained in the  **cloud-utils-growpart/cloud-utils/cloud-initramfs-tools/cloud-init**  package. You can run the preceding command directly and then run the  **growpart**  command to check whether growpart has been installed successfully.  

    3.  Run the following command to obtain the file system type and UUID:

        **blkid**

        The command output is as follows:

        ```
        /dev/xvda1: UUID="25ec3bdb-ba24-4561-bcdc-802edf42b85f" TYPE="swap" 
        /dev/xvda2: UUID="1a1ce4de-e56a-4e1f-864d-31b7d9dfb547" TYPE="ext4" 
        ```

    4.  Stop the ECS and use it to create a private image.

        ```
        [root@sluo-ecs-e6dc-resizefs ~]# poweroff 
        Connection closed by foreign host.
        Disconnected from remote host at 11:08:54.
        Type `helpÂ´ to learn how to use Xshell prompt.
        ```

    5.  Use the created image to provision an ECS with a 50 GB system disk. Log in to the ECS and run the following command to query the expanded partitions:

        **parted -l /dev/xvda**

        As shown in the command output, the root partition has been expanded automatically.

        ```
        Model: Xen Virtual Block Device (xvd)
        Disk /dev/xvda: 53.7GB
        Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B

        2 4296MB 53.7GB 49.4GB primary ext4 boot
        ```

    6.  Run the following command to check whether disks are attached to the VM successfully:

        **df -Th**

        The command output is as follows:

        ```
        Filesystem     Type      Size    Used   Avail Use%  Mounted on

-   <a name="li17770807112053"></a>Root partition not at the last \(for example,  **/dev/xvda1: root**  and  **/dev/xvda2: swap**\)

    For example, if the system disk size of CentOS 7.3 64-bit is 40 GB, perform the following operations to configure a Linux private image that can automatically expand its root partition:

    1.  Run the following command to query the partitions of  **/dev/xvda**:

        **parted -l /dev/xvda**

        As shown in the command output, the root partition is the first partition and is 40.9 GB. The swap partition is the second partition.

        ```
        Model: Xen Virtual Block Device (xvd)

        ```

    2.  Run the following command to check the configuration of the  **/etc/fstab**  file:

        **tail -n 3 /etc/fstab**

        As shown in the command output, UUIDs of the two partitions are displayed.

        ```
        #
        UUID=7c4fce5d-f8f7-4ed6-8463-f2bd22d0ddea /                       ext4    defaults        1 1

        ```

    3.  Run the following command to open the  **/etc/fstab**  file and press  **i**  to enter editing mode:

        **vi /etc/fstab**

    4.  Delete the swap partition configuration, press  **Esc**  to exit editing mode, and run the following command to save the configuration:

        **wq!**

    5.  Run the following command to check whether the configuration has been modified:

        **tail -n 3 /etc/fstab**

        As shown in the command output, only the UUID of the root partition is displayed.

        ```
        UUID=7c4fce5d-f8f7-4ed6-8463-f2bd22d0ddea /                       ext4    defaults        1 1
