# What Is the Cause of the Failure to Install the Guest OS Driver on a Windows ECS?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0030713215"></a>

Any of the following may cause the Guest OS driver installation to fail:

-   Your image file was exported from a VMware VM, and VMware Tools was not uninstalled or not completely uninstalled.

-   You have downloaded an incorrect version of Guest OS driver for your Windows ECS.
-   The disk space available for installing the Guest OS driver is insufficient. Therefore, you must ensure that the disk where the Guest OS driver is installed has at least 300 MB available space.
