## How Can I Use a Rejected Image?<a name="section172701486526"></a>

If you have rejected an image shared by another tenant, but now want to use it, two methods are available:

-   Method 1

    Ask the image owner to add you to the tenants with whom the image is shared. For details, see  [Adding Tenants Who Can Use Shared Images](adding-tenants-who-can-use-shared-images.md).

-   Method 2

    Accept the rejected image again. For details, see  [Accepting Rejected Images](accepting-rejected-images.md).
