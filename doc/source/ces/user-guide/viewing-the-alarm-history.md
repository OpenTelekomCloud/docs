    >-   In normal cases, alarms need to be triggered by calculation. Therefore, the alarm generation time may be a few seconds later than the latest data triggering time.  
    >-   If monitoring data has been obtained, you have created or modified an alarm, and an alarm is triggered, the alarm generation time is dependent on the time when the alarm is triggered by the alarm rule creation or modification.
