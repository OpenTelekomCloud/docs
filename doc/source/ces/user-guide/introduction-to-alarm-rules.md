# Introduction to Alarm Rules<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0084572182"></a>

You can flexibly create alarm rules on the Cloud Eye console. You can create an alarm rule for a specific metric or use the alarm template to create alarm rules in batches for multiple cloud service resources.

Based on years of development and maintenance experience, Cloud Eye provides you with alarm templates tailored to the attributes of each service by default. In addition, Cloud Eye allows you to add custom templates. You can modify the default recommended metrics, or add metrics as needed to create custom templates.
