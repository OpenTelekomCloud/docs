# Application Scenarios<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0084572214"></a>

Cloud Eye provides various application scenarios.

## Cloud Service Monitoring<a name="section114135426153"></a>

After enabling a cloud service supported by Cloud Eye, you can conveniently view the running status of the cloud service, usage of each metric, and create alarm rules for metrics on the Cloud Eye console.

## Resource Exception<a name="section8424191331912"></a>

Based on the alarm rule, Cloud Eye generates an alarm and uses the SMN service to send notifications when the metric data reaches the alarm policy. In this way, you can obtain the exception notification and query the exception cause in time.

## Capacity Expansion<a name="section1052052416206"></a>

After creating alarm rules for metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage, you can track the running status of a cloud service. When you receive an alarm notification or the service volume increases, you can manually expand the capacity or use AS for capacity expansion.

## Custom Monitoring<a name="section1864161119230"></a>

Custom monitoring supplements cloud service monitoring. If Cloud Eye does not provide the required metrics, you can use custom monitoring and report the collected monitoring data to Cloud Eye. Cloud Eye helps to display those monitoring data in graphs and allows you to create alarm rules for those custom metrics.
