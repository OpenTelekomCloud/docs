# What Are the Effects on ECS Metrics If OTC Tools Are Not Installed on ECSs?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0084812088"></a>

If OTC tools are not installed on ECSs, Cloud Eye can still monitor the outband incoming rate and outband outgoing rate. However, it cannot monitor memory usage, disk usage, inband incoming rate, or inband outgoing rate, which reduces data accuracy of the CPU usage.

For details about ECS metrics supported by Cloud Eye, see  [ECS Metrics](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/usermanual/ecs/en-us_topic_0030911465.html).
