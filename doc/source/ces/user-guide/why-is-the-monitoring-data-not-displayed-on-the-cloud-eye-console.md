Possible causes are as follows:

-   The ECS or BMS has been stopped for more than 1 hour.
-   The EVS disk is not attached to an ECS or a BMS.
-   No backend server is bound to the elastic load balancer or all backend servers are shut down.
-   It is less than 10 minutes after a resource is created.
