6.  Specify the subscription protocol and endpoints. You can enter 10 endpoints at most, each on a separate line.
    -   Email

        Enter a valid email address, for example,  **username@example.com**.

        Subscribers will receive a subscription confirmation email valid in 48 hours and must confirm the subscription to receive messages published to the topic.

    -   HTTP/HTTPS

        Enter a public network URL, for example,  **http://example.com/notification/action**. HTTP/HTTPS subscribers must confirm their subscriptions. For details about HTTP/HTTPS messages, see section  [Introduction](introduction-3.md).

    -   SMS

        Enter a valid mobile number preceded by a plus sign \(+\) and a country code, for example,  **+4900000000**.

        Subscribers will receive a subscription confirmation message valid in 48 hours and must confirm the subscription to receive messages published to the topic.

    -   DMS

        Subscription endpoints are message queues. This type of subscriptions does not need confirmation. Click  ![](figures/icon-plus.png)  to select subscription endpoints. Ensure that the queue policy grants the  **DMS:ProduceMessages**  permission to SMN. For details, see "Managing Queue Policies" in the  _Distributed Message Service User Guide_.

7.  Click  **OK**.

    The subscription you added is displayed in the subscription list.

    >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >-   To prevent malicious users from attacking subscription endpoints, SMN limits the number of confirmation messages that can be sent to an endpoint within a specified period of time. For details, see section  [Control on Subscription Confirmation Traffic](control-on-subscription-confirmation-traffic.md).  
    >-   SMN does not check whether subscription endpoints exist when you add subscriptions. However, subscribers will not receive notification messages until they confirm their subscriptions.  
    >-   The token is valid only for 48 hours. Therefore, subscribers must confirm subscriptions within that time.
