# Accessing and Using SMN<a name="smn_pd_25000"></a>

The cloud platform provides a web-based management console and HTTPS-based APIs through which you can access the SMN service.

-   Management console

    The management console is a web user interface for you to manage your computing, storage, and other cloud resources. After you register an account on the management console, you can log in and select  **Simple Message Notification**  on the homepage to switch to the SMN console.

-   API calling

    If you want to integrate SMN into a third-party system for secondary development, you can access SMN using APIs. For details, see the  _Simple Message Notification API Reference_.
