# Creating a Key<a name="en-us_topic_0034330265"></a>

## Scenario<a name="section24085427155358"></a>

This section describes how to create a CMK on the KMS management console. You can create up to 100 CMKs, excluding Default Master Keys.

The CMK is perfectly suited for but not limited to the following scenarios:

-   Server-side encryption on OBS
-   Encryption of data on EVS disks
-   Encryption of private images on IMS
-   File system encryption on SFS
-   Disk encryption for database instances in RDS
-   DEK encryption and decryption for user applications

>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>Aliases of Default Master Keys end with  **/default**. Therefore, in choosing aliases for your CMKs, do not use aliases ending with  **/default**.  

## Prerequisites<a name="section556861155951"></a>

You have obtained an account and its password for logging in to the management console.

## Procedure<a name="section408105191602"></a>

1.  Log in to the management console.
2.  Click  ![](figures/icon-region.png)  in the upper left corner of the management console and select a region or project.
3.  Choose  **Security**  \>  **Key Management Service**. The  **Key Management Service**  page is displayed.
4.  Click  **Create Key**  in the upper right corner of the page. In the dialog box that is displayed, enter the alias and description of the key.

5.  \(Optional\) Add tags as needed, and enter the tag key and tag value.

    >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >-   When a CMK has been created without any tag, you can add a tag to the CMK later as necessary. Click the alias of the CMK. The page with key details is displayed. Then you can add tags to the CMK.  
    >-   The same tag \(including tag key and tag value\) can be used for different CMKs. However, under the same CMK, one tag key can have only one tag value.  
    >-   A maximum of 10 tags can be added for one CMK.  
    >-   If you want to delete a tag to be added when adding multiple tags, you can click  **Delete**  in the row where the tag to be added is located to delete the tag.  

6.  Click  **OK**. The  **Key** _**Key**_ _**alias**_ **created** **successfully**  message is displayed in the upper right corner of the  **Key Management Service**  page.

    In the CMK list, you can view created CMKs. The default status of a CMK is  **Enabled**.
