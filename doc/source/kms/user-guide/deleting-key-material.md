# Deleting Key Material<a name="kms_01_0020"></a>

## Scenario<a name="sca880be282b5423eb210862b51049a3e"></a>

When importing key material, you can specify the expiration time. After the key material expires, KMS deletes it, and the status of the CMK changes to  **Pending import**. You can manually delete the key material as needed. The effect of expiration of the key material is the same as that of manual deletion of the key material.

This section describes how to delete imported key material on the management console.

>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>-   After the key material is deleted, if you need to re-import the key material, the key material to be imported must be the same as that has been deleted.  
>-   After the same key material is re-imported, you can use the CMK to decrypt all data encrypted using this key before deletion.
