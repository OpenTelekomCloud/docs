A region refers to a geographic area where the server for installing CTS is located. AZs in the same geographic area can communicate with each other through internal network.

Data centers \(DCs\) are scattered in different regions around the world, for example, North America, Europe, and Asia. Enabling CTS in different regions makes applications more user-friendly or meet laws or other requirements of different areas.
