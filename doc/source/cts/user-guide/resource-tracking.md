This section describes how to view operation records of any cloud resource throughout its lifecycle and how to check details of a specific operation.

## Prerequisites<a name="section13625028193339"></a>

You have enabled CTS and the tracker is normal. For details about how to enable CTS, see  [Enabling CTS](enabling-cts.md).
