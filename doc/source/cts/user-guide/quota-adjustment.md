## What Is the Quota?<a name="section102291042164212"></a>

Quotas are enforced for service resources on the platform to prevent unforeseen spikes in resource usage. Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources available to users. For example, the CTS quota limits the number of key event notifications that you can create.

If the existing resource quota cannot meet your service requirements, you can apply for a higher quota.
