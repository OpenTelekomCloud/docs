Traces are operation logs of cloud service resources and are captured and stored by CTS. You can view the traces to get to know details of operations performed on specific resources.

There are two types of traces:

-   Real-time traces

    Operation records generated during the last seven days

-   Archived traces

    Historical operation records that have been stored in an OBS bucket
