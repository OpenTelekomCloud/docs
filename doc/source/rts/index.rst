Resource Template Service
==========================


Resource Template Service (RTS) orchestrates cloud resources based on predefined templates and invoke cloud services to obtain resources and deploy applications.
A stack is a collection of resources, including ECSs, networks, and disks. All resources in a stack are defined by a template. You can use the RTS CLI, API, or console to deploy a template. After the template is deployed, all resources in the template are managed as a stack.
