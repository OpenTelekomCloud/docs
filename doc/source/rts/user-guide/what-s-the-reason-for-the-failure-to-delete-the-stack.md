# What's the Reason for the Failure to Delete the Stack?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0101863535"></a>

If you cannot delete a stack, the reason is that the stack is in operation. If the stack is being created, updated, or otherwise manipulated, the stack cannot be deleted until the operation succeeds or fails.
