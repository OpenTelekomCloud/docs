# Updating a Stack<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0076468630"></a>

If the existing stack cannot meet your service requirements, you can use the update function to modify the stack. The procedure for updating a stack is the same as that for creating a stack.

1.  Log in to the management console.
2.  Click  ![](figures/icon-region.png)  in the upper left corner to select the desired region and project.
3.  Under  **Management & Deployment**, click  **Resource Template Service**.
4.  In the stack list, locate the target stack and click  **Update**  in the  **Operation**  column.

    The process of updating a stack is displayed.

5.  Upload a template.

    You can modify the template content or upload a new template file to update the stack. Note that you can replace the template content with another template or upload a new template package to rebuild the stack.

6.  Configure parameters based on the template that you use.

    It takes some time to complete the update.

Go back to the stack list and check whether stack status changes to  **Update complete**. You can also view the updated template and resource information on the stack details page and the entire life cycle of the stack on the  **Events**  page.
