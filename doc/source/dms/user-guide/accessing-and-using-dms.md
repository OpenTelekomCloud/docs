# Accessing and Using DMS<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0143117091"></a>

-   DMS queues:

    There are two ways to access and use DMS queues:

    -   Using APIs

        DMS APIs are used to create queues and creating and retrieving messages. For more information, see the  _Distributed Message Service API Reference_.

        You can download sample code for common API from the DMS console.

    -   Using the DMS console

        The web-based DMS console is used for testing and queue management, for example, creating and viewing queues. However, APIs are more frequently used for sending and consuming messages in real-life scenarios.


-   Kafka premium instances:

    You can use APIs or the console to manage Kafka instances, including creating instances, modifying instances, and creating topics in instances. You can access your Kafka instance using a command line interface \(CLI\) or client to create and retrieve messages. For details on how to use the CLI, see  [Accessing a Kafka Premium Instance](accessing_a_kafka_premium_instance). For details on using the client, see the  _Distributed Message Service Developer Guide_.
