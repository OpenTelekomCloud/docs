# Adding Pay-per-Use EIPs to a Shared Bandwidth<a name="bandwidth_0004"></a>

## Scenarios<a name="en-us_topic_0118499024_section15598193716333"></a>

Add pay-per-use EIPs to a shared bandwidth and the EIPs can then share that bandwidth. You can add multiple EIPs to a shared bandwidth at the same time.

>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>-   After an EIP is added to a shared bandwidth, the original bandwidth size used by the EIP will become invalid. The EIP will use the shared bandwidth.  
>-   The EIP's original dedicated bandwidth will be deleted.
