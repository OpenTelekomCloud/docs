# Unbinding an EIP from an ECS and Releasing the EIP<a name="eip_0003"></a>

## Scenarios<a name="en-us_topic_0118499120_s36c772a5e6194d30b86be9c3d783e9cd"></a>

If you no longer need an EIP, unbind it from the ECS and release the EIP to avoid wasting network resources.

-   EIPs assigned and bound to load balancers in the ELB service are displayed in the EIP list of the VPC service, but you cannot unbind these EIPs from the load balancers.
-   Only unbound EIPs can be released. To release bound EIPs, you must first unbind them.
