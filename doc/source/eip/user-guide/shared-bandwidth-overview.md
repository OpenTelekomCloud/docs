# Shared Bandwidth Overview<a name="bandwidth_0002"></a>

Shared bandwidth allows multiple EIPs to share the same bandwidth. All ECSs, BMSs, and load balancers that have EIPs bound in a region can use the same bandwidth.

When you host a large number of applications on the cloud, if each EIP uses an independent bandwidth, a lot of bandwidths are required, increasing O&M workload. If all EIPs share the same bandwidth, VPCs and the region-level bandwidth can be managed in a unified manner, simplifying O&M statistics and network operations cost settlement.

-   Easy to Manage

    Region-level bandwidth sharing and multiplexing simplify O&M statistics, management, and operations cost settlement.

-   Flexible Operations

    You can add EIPs to or remove them from a shared bandwidth without worrying about the EIP and bound instance types.
