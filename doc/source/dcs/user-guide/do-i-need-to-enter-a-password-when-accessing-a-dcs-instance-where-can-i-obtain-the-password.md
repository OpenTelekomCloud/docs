# Do I Need to Enter a Password When Accessing a DCS Instance? Where Can I Obtain the Password?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0237964737"></a>

Redis allows clients to access cache service directly without any password.

In DCS, additional efforts have been made to harden Redis. A client must enter the correct password before it is allowed to access DCS instances. The instance password is manually assigned when you are creating a DCS instance.
