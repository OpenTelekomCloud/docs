# Why Can't I Back Up or Scale Up My DCS Instances?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0237964748"></a>

-   Only single-node and master/standby DCS instances support specification scale-up, while cluster DCS instances do not.
-   Only master/standby DCS instances support backup and restoration, while single-node and cluster DCS instances do not.
-   DCS instance backup and scale-up are new functions provided by DCS. If your DCS instances were created long time ago, the version of these DCS instances is not upgraded and therefore cannot support some new functions \(such as DCS instance backup and scale-up\). You can contact technical support personnel to upgrade your DCS instance version. After the upgrade, you can back up and scale up your DCS instances.
