# Does DCS Support Data Read/Write in Multiple Databases?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0237964747"></a>

Both single-node and master/standby DCS instances support data read/write in multiple databases. By default, single-node and master/standby DCS instances can read and write data in 16 databases \(databases 0â€“15\).

DCS instances in cluster mode do not support data read/write in multiple databases.
