# How to Access DCS<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0237964760"></a>

There are two ways to access DCS:

-   Using the management console

    The DCS provides a web-based management console. To launch the DCS console, create an account on the management console and log in, and then choose  **Database**  \>  **Distributed Cache Service**  on the homepage. On the DCS console, you can create, restart, and delete DCS instances, and change their passwords.

-   Using APIs

    If you want to integrate DCS into a third-party system for secondary development, use APIs to access DCS. For more information about available APIs, see the  _Distributed Cache Service API Reference_.
