## Access Method<a name="section1142710559429"></a>

You can access SFS on the management console or through APIs by sending HTTPS requests.

-   APIs

    Call APIs if you need to integrate SFS on the cloud service platform into a third-party system for secondary development. For detailed operations, see  [Scalable File Service API Reference](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api/sfs/sfs_02_0001.html).

-   Management console

    You can access SFS on the management console. For details about how to log in to the management console, see  [Logging In to the Management Console](step-1-create-a-file-system.md#section370015372416).


## User Permission<a name="section9612155718233"></a>

The system provides two types of user permissions by default: user management and resource management.

-   User management refers to the management of users, user groups, and user group rights.
-   Resource management refers to the management of user operations that can be performed on cloud service resources.

For details, see  [Permissions](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/permissions/index.html).
