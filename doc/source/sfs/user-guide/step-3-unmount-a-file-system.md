# Step 3: Unmount a File System<a name="sfs_01_0026"></a>

If a file system is no longer used and needs to be deleted, you are advised to unmount the file system and then delete it.

1.  Log in to the ECS.
2.  Run the following command:

    **umount** _Local path_

    _Local path_: Local path used to mount the file system on the ECS, for example,  **/local\_path**.

    >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >Before running the  **umount**  command, stop all read and write operations related to the file system and exit from the local path. Otherwise, the unmounting fails.
