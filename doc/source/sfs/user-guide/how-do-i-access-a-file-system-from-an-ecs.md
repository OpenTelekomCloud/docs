# How Do I Access a File System from an ECS?<a name="sfs_01_0092"></a>

To access your file system, install the NFS client on an ECS running Linux and then mount the file system using the  **mount**  command. For an ECS running Windows, install the NFS client on the ECS, modify the NFS transfer protocol, and then mount the file system by running the  **mount**  command. Then, you can share the files and directories of the file system.
