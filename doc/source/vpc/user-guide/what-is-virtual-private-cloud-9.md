# What Is Virtual Private Cloud?<a name="vpc_faq_0001"></a>

The Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) service enables you to provision logically isolated, configurable, and manageable virtual networks for Elastic Cloud Servers \(ECSs\), improving cloud service security and simplifying network deployment.

You can create security groups and VPNs, configure IP address ranges, and specify bandwidth sizes in your VPC. With a VPC, you can configure and manage the networks within the VPC, making changes to these networks as needed, quickly and securely. You can also define rules for communication between ECSs in the same security group or in different security groups.
