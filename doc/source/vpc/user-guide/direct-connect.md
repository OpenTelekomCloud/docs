Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection between your data center and the cloud platform. With Direct Connect, you can establish a private connection between the cloud platform and your data center, office, or collocation environment, which can reduce your network latency and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.

For more information about Direct Connect, see the  _Direct Connect User Guide_.
