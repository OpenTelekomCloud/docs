# Subnet<a name="en-us_topic_0030969424"></a>

A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC and provides IP address management and DNS resolution functions for ECSs in it. The IP addresses of all ECSs in a subnet belong to the subnet.

By default, ECSs in all subnets of the same VPC can communicate with one another, but ECSs in different VPCs cannot.

To enable ECSs in different VPCs to communicate with one another, you can create a VPC peering connection. For details, see  [VPC Peering Connection](vpc-peering-connection.md).
