-   ECS

    A VPC provides an isolated virtual network for ECSs. You can configure and manage the network as required. The VPC service provides multiple connectivity options for ECSs to access the Internet. You can also define rules for communication between ECSs in the same security group or in different security groups.

-   ELB

    ELB uses the EIP and bandwidth provided by the VPC service.

-   Cloud Eye

    After the VPC service becomes available to you, you can use Cloud Eye to view status of monitored objects of the service without requiring additional plug-ins to be installed.
