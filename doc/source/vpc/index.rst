Virtual Private Cloud
======================


A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is an isolated and private virtual network created on the cloud. You have complete control over your virtual network, and you can assign EIPs, allocate bandwidth, create subnets, and configure security groups. Additionally, you can use Direct Connect or VPN to connect a VPC with your local data center.
