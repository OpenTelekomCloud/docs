# What Is the Relationship Between a VPC and a NAT Gateway, EIP Bandwidth, and ECS?<a name="nat_faq_0003"></a>

-   A VPC is a secure, isolated, logical network environment.
-   The NAT gateway enables ECSs in the VPC to access the Internet.
-   EIP is a service that provides valid static IP addresses on the Internet. The throughput of a VPC is determined by the EIP bandwidth.
-   An ECS is a running instance in the VPC and uses the NAT gateway to access the Internet.
