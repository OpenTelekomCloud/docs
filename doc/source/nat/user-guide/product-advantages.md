The NAT Gateway service has the following highlights:

-   Flexible deployment

    The NAT Gateway service can be deployed flexibly across subnets and AZs. Any fault in a single AZ does not affect the service continuity of NAT Gateway. The types and public IP address of a NAT gateway can be adjusted at any time.

-   Diversified and easy-to-use

    Multiple types of NAT gateways are available. You can use them after simple configuration. NAT Gateway supports easy operation and maintenance \(O&M\) and quick provisioning. They can run stably and reliably.

-   Cost-effective

    Multiple servers can share an EIP. When you send data through a private IP address or provide services accessible from the Internet using a NAT gateway, the NAT Gateway service translates the private IP address to a public IP address. NAT Gateway frees you from worrying about insufficient IP address resources and helps you reduce costs.
