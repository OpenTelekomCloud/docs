# What Can I Do with ECSs?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0018073214"></a>

You can use ECSs just like traditional physical servers. On an ECS, you can deploy any service application, such as the email system, web system, and Enterprise Resource Planning \(ERP\) system. After creating an ECS, you can use it like using your local computer or physical server.
