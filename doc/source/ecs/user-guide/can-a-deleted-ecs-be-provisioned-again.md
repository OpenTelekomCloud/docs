# Can a Deleted ECS Be Provisioned Again?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0018073221"></a>

No. A deleted ECS is retained in the ECS list on the management console for only a short period of time. It is then completely removed from the system and cannot be provisioned again. You can create the ECSs of the same specifications again.
