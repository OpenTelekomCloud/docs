# Modifying a Private IP Address<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0133339807"></a>

## Scenarios<a name="section8230202916388"></a>

The cloud platform allows you to modify the private IP address of the primary NIC. For details, see this section. To modify the private IP address of an extension NIC, delete the NIC and attach a new NIC.

## Constraints<a name="section205851733132119"></a>

-   The ECS must be stopped.
-   If a virtual IP address or DNAT rule has been configured for the NIC, cancel the configuration before modifying the private IP address.
-   If the NIC has an IPv6 address, its private IP address \(IPv4 or IPv6 address\) cannot be modified.
-   Do not modify the private IP address of the ELB backend server.
