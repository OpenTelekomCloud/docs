If an ECS remains in the  **Restarting**  or  **Stopping**  state for over 30 minutes after being restarted or stopped, you can forcibly restart or stop the ECS as follows:

1.  Log in to the management console.
2.  Click  ![](figures/icon-region-0.png)  in the upper left corner and select the desired region and project.
3.  Under  **Computing**, click  **Elastic Cloud Server**.
4.  Select the target ECS and click  **Restart**  or  **Stop**.

    A dialog box is displayed to confirm whether you want to restart or stop the ECS.

5.  Select  **Forcibly restart the preceding ECSs**  or  **Forcibly stop the preceding ECSs**.
