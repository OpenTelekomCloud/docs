-   Domain

    A domain is created upon successful registration. The domain has full access permissions for all of its cloud services and resources. It can be used to reset user passwords and grant user permissions. The domain is a payment entity and should not be used directly to perform routine management. For security purposes, create users and grant them permissions for routine management.

-   User

    A user is created using a domain to use cloud services. Each user has its own identity credentials \(password and access keys\).

    The domain name, username, and password will be required for API authentication.

-   Region

    A region is a geographic area in which cloud resources are deployed. Availability zones \(AZs\) in the same region can communicate with each other over an intranet, while AZs in different regions are isolated from each other. Deploying cloud resources in different regions can better suit certain user requirements or comply with local laws or regulations.

-   AZ

    AZs are physically isolated locations in a region, but are interconnected through an internal network for enhanced application availability.

-   Project

    Projects group and isolate resources \(including compute, storage, and network resources\) across physical regions. A default project is provided for each region, and subprojects can be created under each default project. users can be granted permissions to access all resources in a specific project. For more refined access control, create subprojects under a project and purchase resources in the subprojects. Users can then be assigned permissions to access only specific resources in the subprojects.
