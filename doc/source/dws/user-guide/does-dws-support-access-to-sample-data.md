# Does DWS Support Access to Sample Data?<a name="dws_03_0015"></a>

By default, DWS sample data is stored in the OBS and all cloud service users are granted the access permission.

To access the sample data, use the mounting external buckets function of OBS Browser to load the  **dws**  bucket where the sample data is stored and view the  **dws\_sample\_database\_data\_files**  directory.
