    -   Cannot be the same as the username or the username written in reverse order.
    -   Must contain at least 3 of the following character types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters \~!@\#%^&\*\(\)-\_=+|\[\{\}\];:,<.\>/?
    -   Passes the weak password check.

    -   Be different from the old password and cannot be the reverse of the old password.
    -   Cannot use a history password.
