# DWS Overview<a name="en-us_topic_0049566048"></a>

Data Warehouse Service \(DWS\) is an online data processing database that uses the public cloud infrastructure and platform to help you mine and analyze massive volumes of data.

## Advantages<a name="section3015856394428"></a>

DWS uses GAUSS200 OLAP, which is a self-developed database kernel engine compatible with PostgreSQL 9.2.4. This database kernel engine facilitates transformation from a single OLTP database to an enterprise-class massively parallel processing-based \(MPP-based\) OLAP distributed database of DWS.

Compared with conventional data warehouses, DWS excels in hyper-scale data processing and general platform management and delivers the following benefits:

-   With its MPP-based architecture and row-based and column-based storage, DWS is capable of processing massive volumes of data.
-   Its optimized query model makes complex query operations easier than ever.
-   DWS makes full use of computing resources with its distributed and parallel computing modes.
-   With complete monitoring and management capabilities and a proficient and efficient service management platform, DWS enables you to quickly create a data warehouse cluster, launch your service, and reduce your O&M workload so that you can spend more time and money on your service and application development.
