DWS uses IAM and VPC to control user access and isolate cluster network, ensuring security. When you access clusters, SSL connection and cipher suite are used. Additionally, DWS supports two-way digital certificate authentication.

OSs of nodes in each cluster are hardened for security, that is, only valid access to OS files are allowed, enhancing data security.
