The client tool package contains the following:

    gsql is a command line client running on the Linux OS. It is used to connect to the database in a data warehouse cluster.

    The script for testing sample data is used when you start an example.

-   **GDS tool package**

    Gauss Data Service \(GDS\) is a data service tool. You can use the GDS tool to import a data file in a common file system to the DWS database. The GDS tool package must be installed on the server where the data source file is located. The server where the data source file is located is called a data server or GDS server.
