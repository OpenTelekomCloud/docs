# How Can I Upgrade or Downgrade DWS?<a name="dws_03_0031"></a>

You do not need to perform DWS cluster patching or upgrading because DWS will handle version upgrade automatically.

For service patching:

-   Duration: The whole process will take less than 10 minutes.
-   Impact on services: During this period, services will be interrupted for 1 to 3 minutes.

For service upgrading:

-   Duration: The whole process will take less than 30 minutes.
-   Impact on services: During this period, the database cannot be accessed.

Downgrade is not supported.
