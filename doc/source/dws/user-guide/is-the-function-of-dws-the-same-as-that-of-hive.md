2.  Hive data is stored on HDFS. DWS data can be stored locally or on OBS in foreign table forms.
3.  Hive does not support indexes. DWS supports indexes, so the query speed is higher.
4.  Hive does not support stored procedures, but DWS does. Therefore, DWS has more extensive application scenarios.
5.  DWS supports more SQL statements than Hive, including functions, customized functions, and stored procedures.
6.  Hive does not support transactions. DWS supports complete transactions.
7.  Both Hive and DWS support backups, so the reliability is the same.
