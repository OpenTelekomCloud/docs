# Can I Adjust the Number of Backend Servers When the Load Balancer is Running?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0110859148"></a>

You can add more servers to the load balancer or remove servers from the load balancer at any time, and backend servers can run different operating systems. To ensure service stability, you must ensure that the load balancer can perform health checks normally, and at least one backend server that is running properly has been added to the load balancer.
