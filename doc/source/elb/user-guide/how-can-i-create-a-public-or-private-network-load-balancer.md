# How Can I Create a Public or Private Network Load Balancer?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0091131373"></a>

Both public and private network load balancers are supported.

When creating a load balancer, you can set its network type. If you select  **Private network**, a private IP address will be assigned to the load balancer, and a private network load balancer is created by default. If you select  **Public network**, you need to bind an EIP to the load balancer, through which the load balancer can receive requests over the Internet.
