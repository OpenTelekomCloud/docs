# Should I Adjust the Bandwidth of a Load Balancer Based on the Bandwidth of the Backend Server?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0110733230"></a>

-   Each public network load balancer has an EIP bound and is used to route the traffic to different backend servers in a public network. The load balancer bandwidth is dependent on the incoming traffic. When there is increase in traffic, the load balancer scales up, thus increasing the bandwidth.
-   Private network load balancers are used in an intranet, and there is no need to adjust the bandwidth.
