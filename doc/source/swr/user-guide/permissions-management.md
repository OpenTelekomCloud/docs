# Permissions Management<a name="swr_01_0015"></a>

SWR categorizes user permissions into three types:

-   Read: Users can only pull images.
-   Write: Users can pull and push images, and edit image attributes.
-   Manage: Users can pull and push images, delete images or tags, edit image attributes, grant permissions, and share images with other users.

If the IAM policy  **SWR Administrator**  or  **Tenant Administrator**  is attached to a user, this user becomes an admin user of SWR. An SWR admin user can modify user permissions of images and organizations. If you are not an SWR admin user, contact an SWR admin user to grant you permissions to read, write, or manage a specific image or images in a specific organization.

You can add permissions to users in SWR by using either of the following methods:

-   To allow users to read, write, and manage a specific image, add corresponding permissions to them on the details page of this image.
-   To allow users to read, write, and manage all the images in an organization, add corresponding permissions to them on the details page of this organization.
