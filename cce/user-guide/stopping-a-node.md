# Stopping a Node<a name="cce_01_0036"></a>

After a node in the cluster is stopped, the services on the node are also stopped. Before stopping a node, ensure that discontinuity of the services on the node will not result in adverse impacts.

## Precautions<a name="section1489437103610"></a>

-   Deleting a node will lead to pod migration, which may affect services. Therefore, delete nodes during off-peak hours.
-   Unexpected risks may occur during node deletion. Back up related data in advance.
-   While the node is being deleted, the backend will set the node to the unschedulable state.
-   Only worker nodes can be stopped.
