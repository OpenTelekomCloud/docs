# What Is Cloud Container Engine?<a name="cce_01_0091"></a>

Cloud Container Engine \(CCE\) provides highly scalable, high-performance, enterprise-class Kubernetes clusters and supports Docker containers. With CCE, you can easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications on the public cloud.

CCE is deeply integrated with cloud services, including high-performance computing \(ECS and BMS\), network \(VPC, EIP, and ELB\), and storage \(EVS and SFS\) services. It supports heterogeneous computing architectures such as GPU, ARM, and FPGA. By using multi-AZ and multi-region disaster recovery, CCE ensures high availability of Kubernetes clusters.

You can use CCE through the  [console](https://console.otc.t-systems.com/cce2.0),  [kubectl](kubectl-usage-guide.md), and  [APIs](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api2/cce/cce_02_0344.html). Before using the CCE service, learn about the concepts related to Kubernetes. For details, see  [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/).

-   Junior users: You are advised to use the  [CCE console](https://console.otc.t-systems.com/cce2.0). The console provides an intuitive interface for you to complete operations such as creating clusters or workloads.
-   Advanced users: If you have experience in using kubectl, you are advised to use the  [kubectl](kubectl-usage-guide.md), and  [APIs](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api2/cce/cce_02_0344.html)  to perform operations. For details, see  [Kubernetes APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/)  and  [kubectl CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/).
