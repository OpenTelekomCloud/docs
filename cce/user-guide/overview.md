# Overview<a name="cce_01_0006"></a>

A  workload  is an abstract model of a group of pods in Kubernetes. Kubernetes classify workloads into  Deployments,  StatefulSets,  DaemonSets,  jobs, and  cron jobs.

CCE provides Kubernetes-native container deployment and management and supports lifecycle management of container workloads, including creation, configuration, monitoring, capacity expansion, upgrade, uninstallation, service discovery, and load balancing.

## Basic Concepts<a name="section9568145263015"></a>

-   **Deployment**: Pods are completely independent of each other and functionally identical. They feature auto scaling and rolling upgrade. Typical examples include Nginx and WordPress. For details on how to create a deployment, see  [Creating a Deployment](creating-a-deployment.md).
-   **StatefulSet**: Pods are not completely independent of each other. They have stable persistent storage, and feature orderly deployment and deletion. Typical examples include MySQL-HA and etcd. For details on how to create a StatefulSet, see  [Creating a StatefulSet](creating-a-statefulset.md).
-   **Job**: A job is a resource object that Kubernetes uses to control tasks in batches.

    A job is different from a long-term servo workload \(such as Deployment and StatefulSet\). The former is started and terminated at specific times, while the latter runs unceasingly unless being terminated. The pods managed by a job automatically exit after successfully completing the job based on user configurations. The success flag varies according to the spec.completions policy.

    -   One-off jobs: A single pod runs once until successful termination.
    -   Jobs with a fixed success count: N pods run until successful termination.
    -   Queue jobs: Queue jobs are considered successful based on the global success confirmed by the application.

    For details about how to create a job, see  [Creating a Job](creating-a-job.md).

-   **Cron job**: A cron job runs periodically at the specified time. It is similar to Linux crontab. A cron job has the following characteristics:

    -   Runs only once at the specified time.
    -   Runs periodically at the specified time.

    The typical usage of a cron job is as follows:

    -   Schedules jobs at the specified time.
    -   Creates jobs to run periodically, for example, database backup and email sending.

    For details about how to create a cron job, see  [Creating a Cron Job](creating-a-cron-job.md).


## Relationship Between Workloads and Containers<a name="section16194164519394"></a>

As shown in  [Figure 1](#fig1801862479), a workload controls one or more instances \(pods\). A pod consists of one or more containers. Each container is created from a container image. Pods of Deployments are exactly the same.
