-   **[Managing Node Labels](managing-node-labels.md)**  
You can add different labels to nodes and define different attributes for labels. By using these  node labels, you can quickly understand the characteristics of each node.
-   **[Monitoring a Node](monitoring-a-node.md)**  
CCE is seamlessly integrated with the Cloud Eye service. You can learn the resource usage of the worker nodes in each cluster and monitoring metrics of ECSs in the cluster in real time and receive alarms in a timely manner to ensure smooth service running.
