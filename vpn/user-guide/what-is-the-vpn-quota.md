## What Is a Quota?<a name="section839511291410"></a>

Quotas are enforced for service resources on the platform to prevent unforeseen spikes in resource usage. Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources available to users. For example, the VPN quota limits the number of VPNs that you can create. You can also request more quotas if you need them.

This section describes how to view the VPN resource usage and the total quotas in a specified region.
