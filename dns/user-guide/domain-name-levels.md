# Domain Name Levels<a name="en-us_topic_0035893308"></a>

Domain names are classified into the following levels:

-   Root domain: **.** \(a dot\)
-   Top-level domain: for example, **.com**, **.net**, **.org**, and **.cn**
-   Second-level domain: subdomain names of the top-level domain names, such as **example.com**, **example.net**, and **example.org**
-   Third-level domain: subdomain names of the second-level domain names, such as **abc.example.com**, **abc.example.net**, and **abc.example.org**
-   The next level domain names are similarly expanded by adding prefixes on the left of the previous-level domain names.
