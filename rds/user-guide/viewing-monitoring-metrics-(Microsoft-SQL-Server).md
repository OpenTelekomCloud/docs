The Cloud Eye service monitors operating statuses of RDS DB instances. You can view the RDS monitoring metrics on the management console. For details, see  [Viewing Metrics of Primary DB Instances](#rds_06_0003_section3645894911344)  and  [Viewing Metrics of Standby DB Instances](#rds_06_0003_section1479519207209).

Monitored data takes some time for transmission and display. The RDS status displayed on the Cloud Eye console is the status of the last 5 to 10 minutes. If your RDS is newly created, wait for 5 to 10 minutes and then view the monitoring data.

## **Prerequisites**<a name="rds_06_0003_section5410804111344"></a>

-   RDS is running properly.

    RDS DB instances that are faulty or have been deleted cannot be displayed on the Cloud Eye console. After they are rebooted or restored, you can view their statuses.


>![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>If an RDS DB instance has been faulty for 24 hours, Cloud Eye considers that it does not exist and deletes it from the monitoring object list. You need to clear the alarm rule for the DB instance.  

-   The relational database has been running properly for about 10 minutes.

    For a newly created DB instance, you need to wait for a while before viewing the monitoring metrics.
