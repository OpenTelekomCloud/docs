# Restoring Data from SQL Server Backup Files<a name="rds_05_0044"></a>

You can download backup files by referring to section  [Downloading a Backup File](downloading-a-backup-file.md)  and restore data from them. You can use SQL Server Management Studio \(SSMS\) to connect to a self-built ECS database or local database to restore data. The following uses SSMS as an example to show how to restore data from a backup file on a local database.

1.  Download SSMS and upload it to the ECS for installation.

    Download  **SSMS 18.0 \(GA\)**  from the  [website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017)  and upload it to the ECS.

2.  On the ECS, decompress the RDS full backup file that has been downloaded.
3.  Start the SSMS client.
4.  Log in to the local database service through the SSMS client.
