DB instance deletion has the following constraints:

-   DB instances cannot be deleted when operations are being performed on them. They can be deleted only after the operations are completed.
-   If you delete a DB instance, its automated backups are also deleted and you are no longer charged for them. Manual backups are still retained and will incur additional costs.

>![](/images/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:**   
>-   If you delete a primary DB instance, its read replicas are also deleted automatically. Exercise caution when performing this operation.  
>-   Deleted DB instances cannot be recovered. Exercise caution when performing this operation. If you want to retain data, complete a manual backup before deleting the DB instance.
