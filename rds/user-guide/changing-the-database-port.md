# Changing the Database Port<a name="en-us_topic_change_database_port"></a>

## **Scenarios**<a name="section241540814823"></a>

This section describes how to  change the database port of a primary DB instance or a read replica. For primary/standby DB instances, changing the database port of the primary DB instance will cause the database port of the standby DB instance to also be changed accordingly.

## Constraints<a name="section64561358181355"></a>

You cannot perform the following operations when the database port of a DB instance is being changed:

-   Bind an EIP
-   Delete the DB instance.
-   Create a backup for the DB instance.
-   Restore from backup data or from a specific point in time to the original DB instance.

            1.  If you change the database port of the primary DB instance, that of the standby DB instance will also be changed and both DB instances will be rebooted.
            2.  If you change the database port of a read replica, the change will not affect other DB instances. Only the read replica will be rebooted.
            3.  This process takes 1-5 minutes.

        -   In the dialog box, click  **No**  to cancel the modification.
