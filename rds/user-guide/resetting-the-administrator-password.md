# Resetting the Administrator Password<a name="en-us_topic_reset_password"></a>

## **Scenarios**<a name="section52938762133842"></a>

You can  reset the administrator password  only through the primary DB instance.

If you forget the password of your database account when using RDS, you can reset the password.

You cannot reset the administrator password under the following circumstances:

-   The database port is being changed.
-   The status of the primary DB instance is  **Creating**,  **Restoring**,  **Rebooting**,  **Storage full**,  **Changing port**, or  **Abnormal**.

## Precautions<a name="section5252821142215"></a>

-   If you have changed the administrator password of the primary DB instance, the administrator passwords of the standby DB instance and read replica \(if any\) will also be changed accordingly.
-   The length of time it takes for the new password to take effect depends on the amount of service data currently being processed by the primary DB instance.
-   To prevent brute force cracking and ensure system security, change your password periodically.
