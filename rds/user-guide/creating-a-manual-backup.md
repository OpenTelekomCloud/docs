RDS allows you to  create manual backups  of a running primary DB instance. You can use these backups to restore data.

>When you delete a DB instance, its automated backups are also deleted but its manual backups are retained.

    -   The backup name must consist of 4 to 64 characters and start with a letter. It can contain only uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, hyphens \(-\), and underscores \(\_\).
    -   The description consists of a maximum of 256 characters and cannot contain the carriage return character or the following special characters: \>!<"&'=
