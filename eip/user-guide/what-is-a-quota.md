# What Is a Quota?<a name="faq_common_0001"></a>

Quotas prevent unforeseen spikes in resource usage. Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources available to users. For example, a VPC quota limits the number of VPCs that you can create.

You can also request more quotas if the existing resource quotas cannot meet your service requirements

The system does not support online quota adjustment. If you need to adjust a quota, call the hotline or send an email to the customer service mailbox. Customer service personnel will timely process your request for quota adjustment and inform you of the real-time progress by making a call or sending an email.

Before dialing the hotline number or sending an email, make sure that the following information has been obtained:

-   Domain name, project name, and project ID, which can be obtained by performing the following operations:

    Log in to the management console using the cloud account, click the username in the upper right corner, select  **My Credentials**  from the drop-down list, and obtain the domain name, project name, and project ID on the  **My Credentials**  page.

-   Quota information, which includes:
    -   Service name
    -   Quota type
    -   Required quota
