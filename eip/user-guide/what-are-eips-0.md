# What Are EIPs?<a name="faq_eip_0001"></a>

An EIP is a public IP address that can be accessed directly over the Internet. An EIP consists of a public IP address and some amount of public network egress bandwidth. EIPs can be bound to or unbound from ECSs, BMSs, virtual IP addresses, NAT gateways, or load balancers. 

Each EIP can be used by only one cloud resource at a time.
