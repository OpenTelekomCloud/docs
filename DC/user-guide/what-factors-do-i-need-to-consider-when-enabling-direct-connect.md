# What Factors Do I Need to Consider When Enabling Direct Connect?<a name="dc_faq_0008"></a>

The following factors need to be considered:

-   Bandwidth: Use the bandwidths provided by the providers.
-   Number of connections: Determine whether to create only one connection or two connections for high-reliability redundancy. When PLAS IP is used, two connections are required.
-   Port type when you request connections through email or call: 1GE and 10GE are available.
