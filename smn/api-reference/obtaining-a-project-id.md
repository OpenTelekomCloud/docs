# Obtaining a Project ID<a name="smn_api_66000"></a>

A project ID needs to be specified in the URIs of some APIs. Therefore, you need to obtain the project ID before calling APIs. The following procedure describes how to obtain a project ID:

1.  Log in to the management console.
2.  Click the username and select  **My Credential**  from the drop-down list.

    On the  **My Credential**  page, view project IDs in the project list.

    In multi-project scenarios, expand the region, and obtain your sub-project ID from the  **Project ID**  column.
